Ambani\\nChairman and Managing Director, Reliance IndustriesAdoption of concepts like circularity \\nin our chemical products also brings \\nus closer to a low carbon economy. \\nWe have partnered with accomplished \\ninnovator entities globally, with \\nwhom we share the common goal \\nof establishing a sustainable world \\neconomy. We are leveraging their \\nexpertise to derive maximum value for \\nour new energy initiatives. We recognise \\nthe urgency of addressing the issues \\nemanating from climate change. We \\nbelieve our new energy initiatives will \\ncontribute to the global effort of limiting \\nthe rise in average temperatures. \\nIt is important for us to ensure the \\nwellbeing of our employees and \\ncommunities. We lay great emphasis on \\nthe health, safety and development of \\nall our employees, customers, business \\npartners and local communities. \\nHuman rights considerations have \\nbeen at the core of Reliance’s DNA \\nsince inception. The principles of \\nhuman rights are enshrined in our \\ninternal codes of conduct as well as our \\nbusiness partner codes of conduct. Our \\nReliance Foundation works round the \\nclock driving initiatives in education, \\nhealthcare and social development \\nthat have impacted millions of lives \\nover the years. Abiding by our principle \\nof inclusive growth, our teams across \\nbusinesses work at a grass root \\nlevel to identify the needs of every \\nstakeholder involved and commit to \\nsecuring their interests and maintaining \\ntheir satisfaction.Managing large and diverse \\nbusinesses is not possible without a \\nrobust governance structure. We,\\xa0as \\na company, have always strived \\nto maintain the highest levels of \\ngovernance in our management. \\nWe emphasise the importance of \\nBoard oversight, given the fact that \\nthe company’s diverse and evolving \\noperations impact essential sectors \\nof the Indian economy. The Board \\nCommittees at Reliance have clearly \\ndefined roles and mandates. We are \\ncommitted to adhering to the best \\npractices and to adapting to emerging \\nstandards of governance. \\nPursuing the path of good governance, \\nwe constituted the ESG committee \\nto ensure our continued alignment to \\nbest ESG practices and compliance \\nwith applicable ESG frameworks. The \\ncommittee will advise the board and \\nother committees on environmental, \\nsocial and governance aspects involved \\nin the conduct of business activities.\\nWe have entered an era of \\ntransformation – transformation to a \\ngreener and a more inclusive economy. \\nOur businesses, our people and our \\npractices are evolving and adapting to \\nthe new age with a renewed zest. Our \\nnewest growth engine, our new energy \\nbusiness is poised to become a pioneer \\nand lead the way towards just global \\nenergy transition. \\nCreation of an Independent \\nFinancial Services Business\\nMy dear friends, as you are aware \\nthat this year we have demerged our \\nfinancial services arm into a separate \\nlisted entity named “Jio Financial \\nServices Limited” (JFS). I thank you \\nfor your wholehearted support to \\nthis initiative.\\nToday’s India is young and \\nentrepreneurial, adopting digital \\nfinance at an unprecedented pace. The \\ndigital revolution has penetrated every \\ncorner of the nation through Jandhan \\nAccounts, digital payments, usage of \\nsmart phones and low cost data. The \\ngrowth opportunities presented by \\nfinancial services are remarkable and provide a strong directional support to \\nthe economy. \\nAs various financial services are governed \\nby different regulatory frameworks, \\nwe believe, an independent financial \\nservices entity will allow us to access \\nthe opportunities available in the \\nIndian market. \\nJio Financial Services Limited along \\nwith its subsidiaries will leverage the \\ntechnological capabilities of Reliance \\nand digitally deliver financial services, \\ndemocratising access to financial \\nservices offerings for Indian citizens. \\nJio\\xa0Financial Services aims to provide \\nsimple, affordable and innovative digital \\nfirst\\xa0solutions. \\nJio Financial Services Limited is \\npositioned uniquely to capture the growth \\nopportunities in financial services sector \\nand play a crucial role in transforming the \\nlandscape of digital finance in India. \\nFinancial Performance \\nSummary for the Year\\nThere was continued volatility in the \\nglobal markets amidst disruptions in \\ntrade flows and economic uncertainties. \\nDespite the headwinds, Reliance \\nwas able to deliver another year \\nof remarkable performance both \\non operating and financial fronts. \\nConsolidated EBITDA was at `1,53,920 \\ncrore which is a robust 24.4% growth as \\ncompared to last year. Consolidated net \\nprofit also grew at 11.3% to `73,670 crore.\\nThe impressive growth was well rounded \\nand supported by all our business \\nsegments. Consumer businesses \\ncontinued their growth trajectory with \\na\\xa0rapid expansion of retail store footprint \\nand strong subscriber acquisition \\nin\\xa0Jio. O2C business delivered a record \\nperformance amidst a challenging \\nbusiness environment. \\nA switch to cleaner energy \\nsources is key to our \\ndecarbonisation strategy. \\nWe are making significant \\nstrides in establishing a \\nworld class solar energy \\nvalue chain. We are also \\nprogressing on building a \\ngreen hydrogen ecosystem. \\nOur goal is to provide \\naffordable green hydrogen \\nas a viable alternative to \\ntraditional fuels.\\nOur goal is to become Net Carbon Zero \\nby 2035. Accordingly, the development \\nof giga factories at the Dhirubhai \\nAmbani Green Energy Giga Complex \\nat Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. \\nConsidering the collective potential \\nof our five giga factories, we are well \\non track for establishing a world class, \\nself-sufficient green energy ecosystem. \\nThe transition from traditional fossil \\nfuels to renewable energy sources \\nis going to be a crucial milestone in \\nour history. We, as a company, have \\na proven record of creating value \\nthrough transformational changes, be \\nit the digital revolution through Jio, \\ntransforming consumer experience \\nand the retail landscape in India or \\nthe integration of our refining and \\npetrochemicals businesses into the oil \\nto chemicals value chain.\\nCONSOLIDATED EBITDA \\nH1,53,920  CRORE\\nCONSOLIDATED NET PROFIT\\nH73,670  CRORE\\nDear and esteemed \\nfellow\\xa0shareholders,\\nWe, at Reliance, have a \\ndeep-rooted belief that \\nsustainability is an integral \\npart of enterprise growth. \\nThe tremendous stress that \\nmankind has exerted on \\nnatural resources, since the \\nadvent of the Industrial \\nRevolution, has brought \\nus to a stage where we \\nneed to collectively ramp \\nup our efforts to combat \\nclimate\\xa0change. The Paris Agreement of \\n2015 entered into at the \\n21st Conference of Parties \\n(COP 21) brought the world \\ntogether in this pursuit.  \\nOur company’s ESG \\nambitions are aligned \\nwith this global quest. On \\na personal note, it is a \\nprivilege for me to serve on \\nthe Advisory Committee of \\nCOP 28 UAE, and contribute \\nto this ongoing effort. \\n8 9\\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\\nCHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT\\nOil and gas segment also registered \\na strong performance with sustained \\ngas production from KG D6 block.\\nElevated inflation levels led to an \\naggressive rate hike by central banks \\nthrough the financial year. Our \\nprudent financial framework helped \\noptimise the returns and minimise \\nthe risks while providing adequate \\nliquidity to our businesses. Our strong \\ncash flows from operations have ably \\nsupported growth capex requirements. \\nOver the past 2 years, 98% of the \\ncompany’s capex has been funded by \\ninternally generated cash profits. This \\nhas helped us maintain a strong and \\nconservative balance sheet and retain \\nsuperior investment grade ratings.  \\nRobust Operational \\nPerformance\\nReliance touches the lives of \\nmillions of consumers in India and \\nworldwide through its energy and \\nconsumer businesses. Our teams \\nacross businesses work dedicatedly \\nto achieve operational excellence and \\ndeliver quality performance.Premier League on Jio Cinema. Jio \\nPlatforms powered the technology \\nbehind streaming these events. The \\nnew home broadband back up plan is \\nthe latest addition to the bouquet of \\nbroadband services and is expected to \\ngrow the broadband market further. \\nJio retained its preeminent position \\nin the Indian telecom space with \\n439.3\\xa0million subscribers as on \\nMarch 2023, with a net addition of \\n29.2\\xa0million subscribers during the \\nyear. The strong growth in the digital \\nservices business is aptly reflected in \\nits financial performance for the year. \\nWith an increase of 24.9% from the \\nprevious year, digital services EBITDA \\nfor FY 2022-23 stood at `50,286 crore. \\nJio commits itself to continually \\ninnovate and launch newer \\ntechnologies and products and \\nexpand the market for digital services. \\nJio True 5G stack is one such feature \\nloaded indigenous technology, \\noffering superior performance.

India is expected to \\nremain amongst the fastest growing \\neconomies as per IMF.\\nIndian Economy\\nThe Indian economy remained \\nrelatively stable amidst the global \\nimbalances caused by the Russia- \\nUkraine conflict. The economy grew \\nat 7.2% in FY 2022-23, down from \\n9.1% in FY 2021-22, as per the National \\nStatistical Office data release. \\nThe spike in global commodity prices \\npushed up prices in India too, with \\nretail inflation peaking at 7.79% in April \\n2022, above the medium-term target \\nband of 2%-6% of the RBI. The RBI \\ntook stringent measures to combat \\nthe rising prices, hiking repo rate six \\ntimes in FY 2022-23, from 4% at the \\nbeginning of May 2022 to 6.5% at \\nthe close of the financial year. Private \\nconsumption, however, witnessed \\na strong surge fuelling a boost in \\nproduction across sectors. Domestic \\nsector services activity remained \\nresilient with average Services PMI \\nhigher at 57.5 in FY23 vs 52.2 in \\nFY22. Manufacturing too remained \\nrobust with average manufacturing \\nPMI higher at 55.8 in FY23 vs 54.1 in \\nFY22. Credit growth gained traction \\nwith year-on-year growth of 15% (as \\nof March ’23) while deposit growth \\nlagged with year-on-year growth of \\n9.6%, leading to a rise in incremental \\ncredit-deposit ratio.\\nIndia overtook Japan and Germany \\nto become the third largest \\nautomobile market in terms sales in \\nDecember 2022. India also emerged \\nas the second largest mobile phone \\nmanufacturer globally. India’s digital \\nadoption continues in an accelerated \\nway. UPI payments continued their \\nimpressive run in FY 2022-23, with \\ntransaction volumes almost doubling \\nfrom ~45 billion in FY 2021-22 to ~84 \\nbillion in FY 2022-23, while transaction \\nvalue also surged to ~139 lakh crore in FY 2022-23 from ~84 lakh crore in \\nFY 2021-22. The pan- India monthly \\nmobile data traffic stood at 14.4 \\nExabyte in 2022 with 3.2x growth \\nover last five years. Rapid digitisation \\nsupported by solid infrastructure is \\ndriving efficiency and productivity in \\nthe economy. India’s external sector \\ncontinued to gain strength as FY23 \\nmerchandise exports grew to $447 \\nbillion, growing at 6% Y-o-Y and \\nservices exports grew to $322 billion, \\ngrowing at 27% Y-o-Y.\\nGlobal supply chain improvements \\nand falling commodity prices coupled \\nwith softening domestic demand are \\nlikely to moderate inflation to 5.1% \\nin the current financial year. With \\na growing working age population, \\na large domestic market, boost to \\ninfrastructure development and \\nadvent of digitisation, India is well \\npositioned to be the fastest growing \\nlarge economy in the world. India GDP \\nis expected to grow at 6.5% in FY24.Performance Overview\\nReliance delivered strong annual \\nperformance amid macro headwinds \\ncaused by geo-political conflicts, \\ndisruptions in commodity trade \\nflows and economic downturn. \\nResilience of Reliance’s strategic and \\noperational capabilities reflected \\nin its ability to adapt to dynamic \\nbusiness environments and navigate \\nthrough complex business situations. \\nGrowth was supported by agile and \\nefficient operations by all business \\nteams with sound strategic planning \\nand implementation.\\nEarnings growth was led by rebound \\nin O2C business, backed by healthy \\ndomestic demand, strong fuel \\nmargins and high utilisation rates. \\nOil and gas segment performance \\nreflected volume growth in KG D6 \\ngas production, higher gas price \\nrealisations and margin improvements. \\nOperational efficiencies continued \\nwith 100% uptime.\\nFiscal prudence and proactive risk management formed the guide rails for \\nnavigating a challenging macro environment. Despite synchronised raising of \\npolicy\\xa0rates by Central Banks and volatility in commodity prices, we contained the \\nrise in finance\\xa0costs while ensuring the Balance Sheet has strength and liquidity to \\nsupport growth\\xa0initiatives.\\nGlobal Economy\\nGlobal economy grew 3.4% in CY22, \\nslowing from the post-COVID rebound \\nof 6.2% in CY21. Growth was in-line \\nwith pre-pandemic average (2015-\\n19) of 3.4% despite Russia-Ukraine \\nconflict and aggressive rate hikes by \\ncentral banks. Advanced economies \\n(AEs) saw above-trend growth of \\n2.7% in CY22, higher than the 2.1% \\naverage seen in the five years prior \\nto the pandemic. This was led by \\nstrong growth in both US and Euro \\narea which grew at 2.1% % and 3.5% \\nrespectively. Inflationary pressures \\nremained near multi-decade highs \\nin AEs, with US inflation averaging \\n8% Y-o-Y (highest since 1980s), while \\nEuro area inflation also averaged a multi-decade high of 8.4%. Developed \\nmarket central banks aggressively \\ntightened their monetary policy to \\naddress inflation, with US Federal \\nReserve raising rates by 450bps in \\nCY22, while European Central Bank \\nhiked rates by 250 bps. Emerging \\nMarket and Developing Economies \\n(EMDEs) grew 4% in CY22, below the \\npre-pandemic average of 4.4% due \\nto slowdown in Chinese economy \\namidst frequent lockdowns. China \\ngrowth eased to 3%, well below the \\npre-pandemic average of 6.7% on \\ncontinued zero-COVID policy and \\nhousing downturn. Crude oil prices \\nwere elevated during FY 2023, \\naveraging $93/bbl, remaining above \\n$100/bbl in first half of the fiscal \\nyear due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, but receding in the second half with \\nChinese demand slowing and release \\nof strategic petroleum reserves from \\nOECD countries.\\nGlobal growth is expected to slow in \\nCY23 to 2.8% as the lagged impact \\nof synchronised global monetary \\ntightening. Growth in advanced \\neconomies is expected to decelerate \\nto 1.3%, with US and Euro area \\ngrowth expected at 1.6% and 0.8% \\nrespectively. Effect of rapid rate \\nhikes over last one year as well as \\nemerging credit crunch risks from US \\nregional banks remain key concerns \\nfor advanced economies.

The year was also marked \\nby a sharp depreciation of the Rupee \\nagainst the Dollar. RIL successfully \\nmanaged its Balance Sheet risks \\nthrough the challenging environment \\nwhile ensuring sufficient liquidity for \\nbusiness operations.\\nExternal Environment\\nA persistent broadening of inflation \\npressures triggered a rapid and \\nsynchronised tightening of global \\nmonetary conditions, alongside strong \\nappreciation of the US dollar against \\nmost other currencies. \\nThe rising price pressures were \\nexpected to produce a squeeze on \\nreal incomes as well as undermine \\nmacroeconomic stability. This led \\nmost Central Banks around the world \\nto rapidly lift nominal policy rates \\nto much above the pre -pandemic \\nlevels, both in advanced and \\nemerging market economies. The \\nUS Federal Reserve raised policy \\nrates aggressively by 500 bps in past \\nfifteen months, the fastest hiking \\ncycle since 1980. In Europe, the war-\\nrelated intensification of inflationary \\npressures led European Central Bank \\nto finally exit its negative interest \\nrate regime and ultra-easy monetary \\npolicy after eight years and raise \\ninterest rates by 325 bps in past \\nnine months. The real activity and \\nfinancial markets responded to the \\nremoval of monetary accommodation \\nwith slowing momentum in housing \\nmarket, credit conditions, labour \\nmarkets and PMI surveys. \\nIn response to progressive rate hikes \\nby the Central Banks, the global \\nheadline inflation started declining in \\nthe second half of the year. However, \\nthe decline in inflation print reflects \\nthe sharp reversal in energy and food \\nprices and the core inflation continues to remain sticky. Consequently, to \\nanchor inflation expectations major \\ncentral banks have signalled the need \\nfor staying course on a restrictive \\nmonetary policy stance. \\nOn the other side, the accelerated \\npolicy normalisation has brought \\nforth vulnerabilities in the US regional \\nbanks. The risk of contagion across \\nthe broader financial sector is inducing \\nvolatility in the financial markets and \\ndriving market-implied policy path \\non downside. \\nRBI too raised rates by a cumulative \\n250 bps in the year, in-line with global \\nmonetary tightening as inflation \\nremained persistently above RBI’s 6% \\nupper-target band. As the forward \\noutlook on inflation moderated \\ntowards 5-5.5% in the second \\nhalf of the year, RBI guided for a \\nconditional pause keeping the policy \\nstance focused on withdrawal of \\naccommodation. A prolonged pause \\nfrom RBI is expected to progressively \\nalign headline inflation to its target \\nwhile also supporting growth. \\nOn the external front, a noticeable \\nimprovement in India’s current \\naccount deficit (CAD) on back of \\nmoderation in oil prices and structural \\nstrength in India’s services exports, \\nis expected to keep CAD benign and \\nbelow 2% of GDP. The outlook on \\ncapital inflows also looks promising as \\nemerging markets growth is expected \\nto outperform developed markets. As \\nthe lagged effect of cumulative hikes \\nsets-in, developed markets is expected \\nto witness slowdown. In contrast, India \\nis expected to emerge as the fastest \\ngrowing economy in FY 2023-24 \\nwith 6.5%, while global growth are \\nexpected only at 2.8%. Overall, India’s \\ngrowth differential and comfortable \\nCAD dynamics are expected to keep \\nthe Indian Rupee well supported in \\nthe near to medium-term.\\nDespite the unprecedented \\nmacro -economic uncertainty, the \\nCompany was successfully able to \\nnavigate abrupt adjustments in the \\nmarket, maintain adequate liquidity on its balance sheet, manage its \\nfinancial market risks and deliver a \\nconsistent return on its investment \\nportfolio by staying invested in low \\nrisk, liquid instruments.

However, consumer \\ndemand slowed down in the first half \\nas prices of consumer goods increased \\nto keep pace with raw material \\nprices. The increase in lending rates \\nin the second half also impacted \\nthe industrial growth and consumer \\nspending power. \\nMedia and Entertainment sector, \\nbeing inextricably linked to the \\nmacro -economic environment, \\nalso faced headwinds during the \\nyear. While Y-o-Y growth (CY2022 \\nvs CY2021) was strong at ~20%, \\ncompared to pre-pandemic levels \\nof 2019, total revenue was only \\n10%\\xa0higher. The demand for content \\ncontinued to grow as consumers \\nincreasingly spent more time on \\nmedia consumption, but monetisation \\nfaced challenges on both advertising \\nand subscription fronts. Growth during \\nthe year was driven by 30%5 growth \\nin Digital segment. Digital advertising, \\nincluding spends by small and \\nmedium sized businesses, for whom \\ndigital is often the only marketing \\nplatform due to limited budgets, \\ncommanded more than 50% share of \\nthe total ad revenues. TV’s share in \\nthe total ad pie declined by ~500 bps \\nas the ad revenue on the medium was \\nflat. As per various industry reports, \\nTV and Digital are the most effective \\nmediums for brand building and \\nreach, capturing nearly 80% share of \\nthe total ad spends. Print continued \\nto struggle and despite a 13% Y-o-Y \\ngrowth, it remains well below the \\npre-pandemic levels. While cinema \\nadvertising continues to languish, \\ntheatrical revenues saw a sharp jump INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\\nas consumers returned to cinemas and several movies achieved phenomenal \\nbox-office success. For CY2023, the reports forecast that the M&E industry \\nwill grow at ~12%, led by digital which is expected to grow at ~18% while TV is \\nexpected to grow at low single-digit rate.\\n5 Source : FICCI EY Report 2023INDIAN AD INDUSTRY\\n(` BILLION)\\nJ1 TRILLION\\nAD SPENDS CROSSED THE \\nMILESTONE IN CY2022, \\nGROWING\\xa019% Y-O-YMedia and Entertainment\\nOTT Advertising and \\nSubscription to Continue \\nGrowing\\nGiven the secular trend of increasing \\nsmartphone and internet penetration, \\ndigital medium is expected to \\ncontinue its impressive growth \\nfor the foreseeable future.

Bundling \\nof subscriptions through telecom \\nplans and emergence of aggregator \\nplatforms is also expected to aid \\nthis growth. \\nOTT advertising will continue to \\ngrow on the back of increasing \\ninternet-connected audience, growing \\ntime-spend and improving targeting \\nadvertising capabilities. Internet-connected mobile phones \\nhave been the primary driver for the \\nmassive growth in digital content \\nconsumption, responsible for nearly \\n90% of this growth. However, the \\nengagement levels on big screens \\n(TV) continue to be much higher \\nthan handsets. Connected TVs \\n(CTV) offer the best features of both \\ntraditional and digital eco-system \\n– a large screen size and ability for \\ntargeted advertising, thus providing \\nan opportunity to brands to reach \\npremium audiences in an intelligent \\nfashion. Due to a low penetration of \\nCTVs, advertising on the medium is \\ncurrently at a nascent stage in India, at \\njust over 1% of total TV spends.\\nNew Tariff Order Finally \\nClears Legal Hurdles\\nAfter being mired in multiple \\nlitigation challenges for more than \\ntwo years, the New Tariff Order was \\ncleared for implementation after the \\nregulatory body, TRAI, amended \\nthe regulation post an industry-wide \\nconsultation process. \\nThe proposal to lower the price ceiling \\nfor including a channel in a bouquet \\nto `12 was dropped, reverting to the \\nearlier price limit of `19. Another key \\nproposal to introduce a discount cap \\nof 33% on the bouquet price vis a vis \\na-la-carte price was modified, with the \\ndiscount limit increased to 45%. While \\na few appeals were filed against the \\nnew regulation by some distribution \\nplatforms, it was implemented in \\nFebruary\\xa02023.Connected TVs – A Promising Growth Opportunity\\nKey Hindi General \\nEntertainment Channels \\nmoved out of the DD \\nFreedish Platform\\nAt the beginning of the year, all the \\nmajor broadcasters took their FTA \\nchannels off DD Freedish distribution \\nplatform. This had an impact on \\nviewership, up to 90% for some of \\nthese channels, as they run older \\ncontent which doesn’t get much \\nviewership on pay platforms.\\nSubsequently, it also impacted the ad \\nrevenue growth for these channels \\nand the networks. However, it has \\nhelped to slow down the loss of \\npay-TV subscribers, an issue which \\nhas affected the industry since the \\nimplementation of the New Tariff \\nOrder (NTO) in early 2019, followed 20-23%  \\nCAGRby the pandemic a year later. Given \\nthat the quality of content on these \\nchannels is superior to most of the \\nother content available on the FTA \\nplatform, it provides an incentive for \\nconsumers to upgrade and become \\npay subscribers.Source: Groupm TYNY Report, 202347 %\\nCAGR CTV AD SPENDS IN INDIA \\n2022-2027CTV ADVERTISING SPENDS FORECAST \\n($ MILLION)\\n2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027295786133200286395\\nHowever, with the fast-increasing adoption of CTVs in India, it is expected \\nthat advertising spends on the platform will also follow suit.

At the \\nstart of the year, strong oil demand \\ngrowth was expected as the economy \\ncontinued its recovery from the global \\npandemic. However, Russia-Ukraine \\nconflict introduced huge geopolitical \\nuncertainties and caused energy \\nprices to soar.\\nGlobal oil demand in CY 2022 grew \\nover 2 million b/d from 2021 but \\nremained below pre-pandemic levels.\\nThe Brent crude oil price averaged \\n$96.2/bbl in FY 2022-23 and the WTI \\nspot price averaged $95/bbl. Oil prices \\nrose significantly in the first half of \\n2022 due to geopolitical tension but \\ndeclined in the second half of the year.INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\\nNatural gas witnessed record high \\nprices in 2022 due to steep decline \\nin Russian piped gas supply to \\nEurope, higher gas burn in the power \\nsector and strong storage injections. \\nEurope TTF spot prices averaged a \\nrecord high of $38/MMBtu in 2022 \\nwhile Henry Hub prices averaged \\n$6/MMBtu, their highest level \\nsince 2008. Asian spot LNG prices \\nalso averaged $32.96/MMBtu for \\nFY 2022-23 which is highest level \\non record.\\nRecord high gas prices led to \\nan unprecedented reduction in \\ngas demand in industry in 2022. \\nGas consumption declined by an \\nestimated 2% in Asia and 13% in \\nEurope (over 70 BCM). United States \\nexperienced growth of 5.4% in gas consumption largely due to colder \\nthan average temperatures during the \\nheating season.\\nLNG demand was dominated by a \\nsharp surge in gross LNG imports \\ninto Europe, which was balanced \\nby a steep decline in the rest of the \\nworld, particularly in Asia. LNG supply \\ngrowth was relatively modest in 2022 \\nat 5.5%, despite an unprecedented rise \\nin LNG demand in Europe following \\nthe gradual decline in Russian pipeline \\ngas deliveries throughout the year.\\nThe Govt. of India appointed Dr. Kirit \\nParikh Committee to review domestic \\nnatural gas pricing. The Committee \\nrecommended removal of price ceiling \\non gas produced from High Pressure \\nHigh Temperature (HPHT) fields from \\nJanuary 1, 2026.PERFORMANCE UPDATE  F\\nFY 2022-23 FY 2021-22 % change Y-o-Y\\nRevenue ( ` crore) 16,508 7,492 120.3%\\nEBITDA ( ` crore) 13,589 5,457 149.0%\\nEBITDA margin (%) 82.3% 72.8% 950 bpsRevenues and EBITDA were up \\n120.3% and 149.0% respectively. \\nThis was mainly due to higher price \\nrealisation along with increase in \\nthe gas production as compared to \\nFY 2021-22.VISION\\nTo be a major contributor to India’s Gas based \\neconomy supplying ~30% of India’s production.\\nMISSION\\nOur mission is to maximise stakeholders’ value by \\nfinding, producing and marketing hydrocarbons and \\nto provide sustainable growth while catering to the \\nneeds of customers, partners, employees and the \\nlocal communities in which we do business.

Global warming \\nis having a compounding effect on the climate system, resulting in increased humanitarian challenges and further \\nstraining already stretched fiscal balances. \\nFor businesses, climate change risks manifests in two broader categories, namely physical and transition risks, as \\noutlined by global frameworks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts on a company caused by both short-term \\nextreme weather events (acute) and long-term changes in climate patterns (chronic). On the other hand, transition \\nrisks pertain to the potential hazards businesses may face as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system \\nwhich includes risks due to policy changes, legal action, technological advancements, shifts in supply and demand, \\nand changes in stakeholder attitudes.Risk and Governance\\nClimate Change and Energy TransitionStrategic and  \\nCommercial RisksSafety and \\nOperational RisksCompliance and  \\nControl RisksFinancial  \\nRisks\\nStrategic and Commercial RisksRISKS AND RESPONSE\\nPhysical Risk\\nThroughout the year, an array of \\nclimate change induced weather \\nevents was experienced around \\nthe globe and in India too. These \\ncalamities included extreme weather \\nevents like intense heatwaves, \\ncyclones, erratic rainfall, floods, \\nand others, affecting almost every \\nregion of the country and causing \\nunprecedented levels of destruction. \\nHaving a wide geographical spread, \\nthe organisation is susceptible to \\nsuch erratic weather phenomenon \\nwhich could cause disruptions in \\nits operations and supply chains, in \\naddition to causing negative impact \\non the wellbeing of our people and \\nour assets.Transition Risk\\nRisks Related to Policies, Law and \\nRegulations\\nDriven by ongoing geopolitical \\ntensions and the urgency to act on \\nclimate change, a new global energy \\norder is emerging - leading to a \\nshift in the way energy is produced \\nand consumed. This gradual move \\naway from fossil fuels is prompting \\nan increased focus on developing \\npolicies, incentives and regulatory \\nframeworks that can bolster the \\nadoption of low-carbon technologies \\nand green products - which may \\nimpact the demand for RIL ’s current \\nproducts. Additionally, the envisaged \\ndevelopment of a domestic carbon \\nmarket regime and thereby the likely \\nintroduction of stricter regulations \\nrelated to GHG emissions may impact \\nRIL ’s operating costs.Natural Capital Human Capital Manufactured Capital N\\nImpact on:   N, all businessesIntellectual Capital Social and Relationship Capital Financial CapitalH M\\nI S F\\nAdditionally, long term changes \\nin climate patterns causing rising \\ntemperatures and sea levels \\nmay also expose our operations \\nto future impacts of worsening \\nclimate change, which can impact \\nour business continuity in certain \\nvulnerable regions.\\nRisk Response\\nReliance has robust business \\ncontinuity management plans \\nto manage risks arising from the \\nphysical impacts of climate change \\nevents. Each business segment \\nafter thorough evaluation of risks \\nand its impact, develops these plans \\nto ensure uninterrupted availability \\nor swift recovery of essential \\nbusiness processes, resources and operations.

This will help Reliance evaluate the cross-impact of \\nmaterial issues on the environment and society against its impact on the Company. Double materiality assessment will \\nallow the Company to recognise the impact of material issues holistically and enhance the transparency and breadth of \\nESG disclosures. \\nMaterial Issue and Associated Capital\\n  Reliance’s O2C operations have a greater environmental \\nimpact than its Retail and Telecom businesses. Abating emissions \\nfrom O2C is challenging due to the nature of its activities. Burning \\nfossil fuels during O2C operations releases greenhouse gases \\n(GHG), resulting in environmental impacts such as air and water \\npollution, habitat destruction, and the release of toxic chemicals.  Reliance faces several physical and transitional risks related to \\nclimate change. Physical risks include climate-related events that \\ncan impact the Company’s financial stability and value creation \\ncapabilities. Transitional risks stem from changes in the energy \\nmarket as the world progresses towards a more sustainable future \\nand embraces cleaner energy forms. Failure to adapt to these \\nchanges could lead to decreased profitability and stakeholder \\nvalue and regulatory penalties.Climate Change N\\n  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  Reliance’s O2C business has significant environmental \\nimpacts related to GHG emissions, water use, waste generation, \\necosystems and biodiversity. In addition, the O2C business can \\nnegatively impact the health and wellbeing of stakeholders, \\nincluding workers, local communities, and consumers.  Effective environmental management is important for \\nReliance to comply with regulations, avoid legal risks, and \\nmaintain a positive reputation. It is, therefore, critical for the \\nCompany to assess potential risks associated with its operations \\nand mitigate them by reducing emissions, minimising water \\nuse, and preventing waste and pollution. Failure to do so \\ncould result in legal action, fines, and reputational damage. \\nPrioritising environmental sustainability demonstrates Reliance’s \\ncommitment to responsible corporate citizenship, protecting \\nbrand reputation and contributing to a more sustainable future.Managing Environmental Impacts N\\n  Reliance’s O2C business can have a negative impact \\non biodiversity through various activities such as habitat \\nfragmentation, deforestation, and erosion. This can result in \\nthe loss of habitats for wildlife, as well as cause a decline in the \\ndiversity and abundance of species.  Non-compliance with regulations related to land use, \\ngreenfield expansions, rehabilitation and redevelopment can \\nexpose the Company to regulatory and legal risks. Hence, it \\nbecomes imperative for Reliance to work with all stakeholders \\nand address ecosystem and biodiversity issues. Ecosystem and Biodiversity N\\n  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  Reliance’s O2C operations generate high volumes of \\nhazardous waste that can negatively impact the environment and \\nhuman health. Reliance Retail and Jio also generate substantial \\nwaste from the use of paper, plastic, and packaging. Appropriate \\nwaste management practices are essential to minimise their \\nimpact on people and the planet. Reliance undertakes various \\ninitiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainability across its \\nbusiness segments, such as recycling PET bottles and used PPEs \\nand developing and deploying waste-to-road and waste-to-oil \\ntechnology solutions.  The Company generates various forms of waste from the \\nprocessing and storage of petroleum products. Many of these \\nsubstances are hazardous to human health and the environment \\nand may be subject to regulations. Reliance O2C unit reduces \\nand recycles hazardous waste streams and has effective and \\nprompt clean-up and remediation measures to ensure seamless \\noperations. The Company has a structured process to manage \\ndecommissioned facilities to reduce regulatory and litigation risks \\nand associated costs.Waste Management and Circular Economy N  The Company’s operations across business segments \\nimpact Goal 3, underlined in the UN SDGs, which aims to ensure \\nhealthy lives and promote wellbeing for all.\\nUN SDG: 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including \\nfinancial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare \\nservices and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable \\nessential medicines and vaccines for all.\\nUN SDG: 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths \\nand illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil \\npollution and contamination.  Workers involved in various manufacturing activities could \\nface significant health and safety risks due to the harsh working \\nenvironments and the hazards of handling oil and gas. In addition \\nto acute impacts resulting from accidents, workers may develop \\nchronic health conditions. Therefore, worker health and safety \\nperformance can have an impact on Reliance’s operations and \\nprofitability. RIL recognises the importance of healthy and safe \\nworking conditions as a human right, implementing a globally \\nbenchmarked HSE framework across all sites, services, and officesHealth, Safety and Employee Wellbeing H\\n  Reliance has robust talent management systems to identify \\nhigh-potential employees and provide opportunities for career \\ngrowth and development. This helps to retain top talent, create \\na culture of continuous learning, and build a more skilled and \\nknowledgeable workforce that can drive business performance \\nand innovation. Effective talent management plays a crucial role \\nin improving both employee experience and client satisfaction, \\nwhich ultimately leads to higher business performance and \\nReturn on Investment for Reliance.  Reliance offers peer-benchmarked monetary and non-\\nmonetary benefits to enhance employee engagement and \\nimprove retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve \\nemployee engagement and work-life balance can positively \\ninfluence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.Talent Management H\\n  Maintaining cordial labour relations is crucial for Reliance \\nto ensure the wellbeing and productivity of its workforce. A \\nhealthy labour relationship means that both the management \\nand the employees are led by a common purpose, which \\nresults in improved job satisfaction, employee retention, and \\norganisational performance.  The Company’s significance to the economy as a major \\nemployer means that it is also often at the centre of public \\ndiscussions around labour practices. Therefore, poor performance \\nin labour relations can have serious reputational implications for \\nthe Company.\\nCustomers regularly interact directly with employees in the \\nRetail business. Reliance can face a decrease in market share and \\nrevenues from negative customer sentiments generated due to \\npublic disagreements between the Company and its workers.Labour Management H\\n  Vulnerable sections of the population, with limited \\ncapacity to defend their rights and interests, may need added \\neffort and support to ensure their human rights are protected. \\nThe\\xa0Company’s governance structures and actions can account \\nfor the same.  Reliance faces additional community-related risks when \\noperating in sensitive areas to protect human rights and areas \\nwith vulnerable communities such as indigenous peoples. If \\nReliance is perceived to be violating human rights or failing to \\naccount for indigenous peoples’ rights, the operations of the \\nCompany may be affected due to protests, riots, or suspension \\nof permits.Human Rights H→ PAGE 175\\n→ PAGE 174\\n→ PAGE 180\\n→ PAGE 180→ PAGE 186\\n→ PAGE 191\\n→ PAGE 195\\n→ PAGE 195\\n166 167\\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nINTEGRATED APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  Reliance has an effective mechanism to address the \\ngrievances of all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, \\ncustomers and communities. This encourages stakeholders to \\ncommunicate their concerns to the management and expect \\nprompt redressal.  Establishing effective grievance redressal mechanisms is \\nessential for Reliance to track the issues raised by stakeholders \\nand take immediate action to resolve their concerns.Grievance Redressal Mechanisms H\\n  Reliance places a high priority on regulatory compliance, \\nespecially in an evolving regulatory environment. The Reliance \\nCompliance Management System is a comprehensive, digitally \\nenabled framework regularly updated and integrated with \\nbusiness processes, risks, and controls. The Group Compliance \\nCommittee monitors regulatory changes and provides timely \\nupdates to Directors on key developments and judicial rulings.  Reliance gains a competitive advantage by staying \\ncompliant as it demonstrates a commitment to transparency and \\naccountability that is valued by customers, investors, and other \\nstakeholders. In addition, compliance also promotes workforce \\nengagement and retention, as employees feel proud to work for a \\ncompany that upholds high ethical standards.Regulatory Issues and Compliance G\\n  Reliance places utmost importance on employees and \\nensures a reduction in the likelihood and severity of potential \\nproject risks through early identification and a ready action plan to \\nhandle untoward incidents.  For Reliance, identifying and addressing probable risks \\nproactively is critical to improving the likelihood of achieving \\nbusiness objectives successfully.Risk Management R  Reliance is working on its Net Zero strategies led \\nby investments to set up the world’s largest integrated \\nmanufacturing ecosystem for green energy. By prioritising \\neconomic performance, Reliance can increase its profitability and \\ncompetitiveness and accelerate its progress on the Net Carbon \\nZero journey, benefiting its stakeholders, including shareholders, \\nemployees, customers, and suppliers.  Extreme climatic situations can derail Reliance’s business \\noperations across O2C, E&P, Retail and Telecom and impact \\nthe Company’s economic performance. Reliance is mindful of \\nthis and has set a goal to become a Net Carbon Zero company \\nand created new growth engines, like the New Energy business. \\nFuture-proofing the Company against the disruptions of climate \\nchange is critical to protect its ability to grow revenue and profits, \\nmanage expenses and allocate resources, and generate adequate \\ncash flows.Economic Performance F\\n  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People   Impact on the Company  The Company has helped boost the socioeconomic \\nwellbeing of several local communities through its operations \\nacross India. Raw material security can directly impact Reliance’s \\nability to generate employment for local communities. A lack \\nof raw material security may cause the Company to move \\nits operations to different locations leaving behind overused/\\nexploited spaces for local communities.  The availability of raw materials is crucial for the smooth \\nrunning of Reliance’s business operations. Judicious use of raw \\nmaterials can have long standing impact on the Company and \\nlocal economy. Raw material security provides investors and other \\nkey stakeholders confidence in the ability of the Company to \\nrun operations seamlessly. The availability of raw materials can \\nalso directly impact Reliance’s ability to meet market demand for \\nits products.Raw Material Security M\\n  The Company’s R&D team has a strong focus on developing \\nsustainable solutions and alternatives to preserve the natural \\nenvironment. Reliance’s streamlined processes and efficiency \\nenhancements have significantly improved the quality of life for \\nmany. Reliance innovations have led to higher productivity, better \\nresults and increased motivation among people to do better.  Reliance’s ability to adapt to changing trends and technology \\nhas made the Company one of the most successful businesses \\nin the country. Reliance’s R&D operation is a crucial growth \\nengine for the Company. Evolving market trends drive Reliance to \\ndevelop innovative solutions and streamline existing mechanisms \\nconstantly. Innovation also accelerates organisational growth and \\nstrengthens the Company’s industry leadership.Innovation and Technology I  Strong supply chain standards, monitoring mechanisms and \\nongoing engagement models with suppliers to address labour \\nconcerns are critical for Reliance to protect shareholder value over \\nthe long term. Sustainable supply chains are essential to further \\nthe Company’s progress on its Net Carbon Zero goal.  Reliance Retail relies heavily on third-party manufacturing \\npartners. Any failure on the part of suppliers to comply with \\ndynamically changing regulations and issues of human rights \\nviolations can disrupt the Company’s operations and create \\nnegative sentiments amongst stakeholders, including customers \\nand impact business. The Company has a structured approach \\nto enhancing supplier performance, deepening sustainability \\npractices, and a well-defined Code of Conduct that mandates \\nrespect for human rights across the value chain.Sustainable Supply Chain Management S\\n  Data privacy is a global concern that has increased \\nsignificantly in the past few years. Access to private data and lack \\nof digital privacy threatens the security and safety of millions of \\npeople worldwide. Reliance’s digital business is susceptible to \\ndata breaches, and the Company has implemented cutting-edge \\nsecurity measures and complies with all applicable regulations to \\nprotect its customers’ privacy.  Data breaches can result in the leakage of confidential \\ncompany information. Reliance’s extensive digital presence \\nand large market share makes it a common target for such \\nbreaches. The Company has implemented several initiatives to \\nmake its technology framework secure and resilient and protect \\nconfidential assets and information.Data Privacy and Cybersecurity I  Reliance has a well-established Code of Conduct that \\nis applicable to its employees and the value chain, supported \\nby strong governance structures and business practices to \\nprevent corruption and wilful or unintentional participation in \\nillegal or unethical payments or gifts to government officials or \\nprivate persons.  Managing business ethics and maintaining appropriate \\nlevels of transparency in payments to governments or individuals \\nare significant issues for Reliance. Strong relations are critical to \\nensure the Company’s ability to conduct business. Inappropriate \\naction or violation of business ethics could lead to significant \\none-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs. Reliance \\nensures compliance with all regulations and has a well-established \\nCode of Conduct that mandates ethical business behaviour \\nat all times. These measures offer adequate risk mitigation \\nopportunities and prevent adverse outcomes.Business Ethics, Integrity and Transparency H\\n→ PAGE 195\\n→ PAGE 195\\n→ PAGE 200\\n→ PAGE 208\\n→ PAGE 203→ PAGE 222\\n→ PAGE 42\\n→ PAGE 228\\n→ PAGE 130,  158\\n168 169\\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nINTEGRATED APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Driving ESG Growth in Reliance\\nINTERPLAY OF CAPITALS\\nCircularity initiatives like PET recycling, \\nwaste-to-road, waste-to-oil, and circular \\npolymer development will enhance the \\nresponsible use of natural capital.\\nBiomass and coal conversion will \\nimprove energy security and reduce \\nenvironmental impact.The transition to new and alternative \\nsources of energy will generate additional \\ndirect and indirect employment.The investment of `75,000 crore \\nwith a readiness to double investment \\nwill further the Company’s goals \\nrelated to energy transition, enhance \\nrenewable energy usage and operational \\neco-efficiency, and broaden focused \\nresearch for the New Energy business.The establishment of 5 Giga factories \\nwill help accelerate the Company’s Net \\nCarbon Zero journey.Collaborations with several \\nautomobile manufacturers and various \\nstakeholders are in place to promote \\nsustainable transportation. \\nMultiple partnerships with global \\nleaders have been established to \\nadvance the battery, fuel cell, and \\nelectrolyser ecosystem.\\nReliance’s vision of new and alternate \\nenergy will be propelled by the addition \\nof a workforce possessing new skills.Reliance’s strong talent pool, supported \\nby IP initiatives, contributes to the \\ncreation of intellectual property and \\ntechnology expertise that enhance the \\nCompany’s R&D capabilities.Establishing a skilled talent pool is \\nimperative to ensuring business resilience \\nand dovetailing corporate performance \\nmeasures to individual skillsets \\nand capabilities.A skilled workforce helps in developing \\ntechnologically advanced assets and \\nensuring their optimum utilisation.Reliance upholds positive relationships \\nwith communities, customers and \\nsuppliers by providing employees \\nwith training and development \\nopportunities, promoting ethical \\nbehaviour, and engaging in corporate \\nsocial responsibility initiatives \\nincluding volunteering.\\nDevelop new and alternate energy \\nsources and business lines including new \\nmaterials like carbon fibre, high value \\nchemicals and green materials.Deployment of new technologies like \\ncontinuous catalytic pyrolysis and true \\n5G services on a commercial scale.Rapid digitalisation of processes \\nto enhance employee safety in \\ncritical operations.Revenue: `9,74,864 crore.\\nCapital expenditure: `1,41,809 crore.\\nEBITDA: `1,53,920 crore.Reliance is accelerating Jio 5G rollout \\nin multiple locations across India to \\nimprove digital accessibility.\\nR&D push to generate value from waste: \\nwaste-to-road, waste-to-oil, bio-fuel, \\nbiodegradable plastic.\\nTimely investments in clean energy \\nbusiness will diversify Reliance’s \\nportfolio, capture emerging opportunities \\nin renewable sector and promote \\nsustainable development by reducing \\nenvironmental impact.A significant investment of `3,001 \\ncrore for research and development \\ndemonstrates the Company’s dedication \\nto maintaining a competitive edge and \\ncreating a roadmap for sustainable \\ngrowth and success.Strategic investments in enhancing \\nemployee learning and development \\ninterventions will help build a \\nfuture -fit workforce.Investing in renewable manufacturing \\nfacilities can help capture emerging \\nopportunities, promote sustainable \\ndevelopment, and achieve \\noperational efficiency.Ensuring the wellbeing of communities, \\npartners and customers generates \\ngoodwill and deepens trust \\nand support for the Company, \\nwhich is critical for seamless and \\ndisruption -free operations.\\nReliance Foundation was conferred the \\nIAA Olive Crown Award in 2022 under \\nthe \\'Green NGO of the year - Silver\\' \\ncategory for its initiatives to conserve \\nnatural resources and promote ecological \\nsustainability across India.Reliance is actively fostering the start-up \\necosystem and partnering with global \\nand local producers and technology \\nleaders to accelerate innovation and \\nprogress on its Net\\xa0Carbon Zero journey.Employee volunteering is a key \\naspect outlined under the Company’s \\nphilosophy of \\'We Care\\'. \\nIn FY 2022-23, Reliance Foundation \\nreached over 8,100 underprivileged \\nchildren through employee \\nvolunteering initiatives.In FY 2022-23, Reliance has spent \\n`1,271\\xa0crore towards CSR activities that \\ncatalyse societal development.

Ambani\\nChairman and Managing Director, Reliance IndustriesThe tenets of Institutional Leadership \\nCapacity Building\\nAt the 45th Reliance AGM held on August 29, 2022, the \\nChairman, outlined the Company’s ten tenets for building \\nleadership capital through nurturing the Founder Mindset \\nat Reliance – now and in the future.\\nAmong the ten capitals outlined, the following eight are designed to strengthen the Company’s Human Capital.\\nPeople \\nCapitalReliance has an ongoing focus on human capital development by investing in and nurturing the skills, \\nknowledge, and abilities of the workforce. Mentoring is facilitated for employees to gain valuable insights \\ninto the Company culture and best practices, enhance productivity and grow professionally. \\nCapability \\nCapitalPromoting Capability Capital entails investing in and nurturing the skills, knowledge, and abilities of \\nemployees to expand their capabilities and improve their performance. Reliance ensures this through \\ncareer acceleration programmes designed to help employees advance their careers through training and \\ndevelopment opportunities, mentoring, and coaching.\\nTalent review and succession planning helps identify employees most likely to be successful in leadership \\nroles and other key positions. \\nAchievement \\nCapitalTo build a positive culture of recognition and motivation within the Company, Reliance rewards and \\nhonours achievers who exceed expectations. This reward might be in the form of financial incentives, \\npromotions, plaques or public recognition. \\nRelationship \\nCapitalTo strengthen relationship capital within the organisation, Reliance fosters a positive and inclusive \\norganisational culture through regular team-building activities, open and transparent communication, \\nand opportunities for employees to connect outside of work. Regular meetings, clear and concise \\ncommunication channels, and opportunities for employees to work together on projects and initiatives to \\npromote effective communication and collaboration. \\nTrust Capital Trust is a critical component of functioning at Reliance since it allows people to work together effectively, \\nmake decisions quickly and confidently, and build long-term relationships. At Reliance, leaders and \\nmanagers are encouraged to promote transparency and build regular communication with employees at all \\nlevels to create and maintain a sense of trust. \\nCooperation \\nCapitalReliance believes that cooperation is essential to achieving goals and objectives, as it allows people \\nto work together effectively and maximise their collective expertise and resources. The Company has \\nincluded cooperation as an integral part of its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and promotes cross-\\nfunctional collaboration. \\nReliance has created channels for open and regular communication and feedback to help employees work \\ntogether effectively and solve problems quickly and efficiently. \\nEmpathy \\nCapitalReliance believes compassionate capitalism needs compassionate leaders. Empathy capital at Reliance \\nis symbolic of the organisation’s compassionate leadership. Empathy is important for Reliance because it \\nallows people at the Company to connect with one another on a deeper level, understand and respect one \\nanother’s perspectives and experiences, and work together more effectively. \\nReliance also highlights empathy capital by encouraging employees to give back to the community and be \\nsocially responsible.\\nIntegrity \\nCapitalReliance upholds the highest standards of integrity and ethical behaviour. Ethics is one of the five \\nenablers of the Company’s strategy and, is a source of our competitive strength. Reliance is committed \\nto establishing a culture of integrity, transparency, openness and compliance – as evident in our Values, \\nBehaviours, and Code of Conduct. \\nReliance considers itself an integral part of the business ecosystem and takes it upon itself to extend \\nall support to our business partners to also work towards ethical conduct of business. Towards this, an \\ne-learning module – \"Satarkata\" – has been rolled out, and access is provided to identified business \\nassociates. This will help vendors better understand Reliance’s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) \\nand create the right levels of awareness about the Company’s expectations of ethical conduct from \\nbusiness partners.  Labour Management \\nand Human Rights\\nReliance follows the principles of \\nthe United Nations Global Compact \\non human rights, labour practices, \\nenvironmental protection, and \\nanti-corruption. The Company’s \\noperations adhere to local and \\nnational regulations and also ensure \\nadherence to the Code of Conduct. \\nCollective bargaining agreements cover \\nthe majority of permanent workers \\nacross all manufacturing facilities. No \\ninstances of child labour, forced labour, \\ninvoluntary labour, sexual harassment, \\nor discriminatory employment were \\nreported during the reporting period. \\nMen and women in the same roles \\nreceive equal pay at the entry-level \\nin Reliance.\\n  Business Ethics, \\nIntegrity and \\nTransparency\\nReliance’s Code of Conduct defines \\nthe behaviour expected from all the \\nemployees and stakeholders and \\nlays down the policies and systems \\nfor effective implementation. These \\nguidance documents enable employees \\nto operate with ethics, integrity and \\ntransparency at all times. The HR \\nLeadership periodically evaluates \\nthe people policies to keep them \\nrelevant to changing regulatory and \\nmarket requirements. \\nAn Ethics and Compliance Task Force \\n(ECTF) is in place to oversee and \\nmonitor the implementation of ethical \\nbusiness practices within Reliance. All \\ncomplaints related to ethics, non-\\ncompliance and violations of the \\nCompany’s Code of Conduct received \\nby ECTF are reviewed and reported to \\nthe Audit Committee every quarter. \\nReliance has proactively taken measures \\nto combat bribery and corruption. The \\nCompany has established a robust \\nAnti-Bribery Management System \\n(ABMS) as an additional pillar to support \\nexisting governance mechanisms. \\nABMS is a systematic framework of policy and processes set up by Reliance \\nto help prevent, detect and respond to \\nbribery risks. \\nThe Company has mandatory e-learning \\ncourses to help employees understand \\nthe norms required to work in a safe, \\ncompliant and ethical manner through \\nthe ABMS system. The learning \\nmodule sensitises employees about \\nthe concept of bribery, how it happens, \\nand its various types, causes, and \\neffects. The module helps recognise \\nred flags indicating bribery, advises \\nabout overcoming bribery, and explains \\nthe link between ABMS and Reliance’s \\nCode of Conduct. The module also \\nemphasises the importance of ABMS \\nviolation reporting. It highlights \\nReliance’s expectations from employees \\nand business associates in the context \\nof its Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption \\n(ABAC) policy.\\nTo benchmark itself against the best \\nin class, Reliance has adopted the ISO \\n37001:2016 standards for its ABMS.\\n  Grievance Redressal \\nMechanisms\\nEmployees and other stakeholders are \\nrequired to report actual or suspected \\nviolations of applicable laws and \\nregulations and the Code of Conduct. \\nReliance has established a robust \\nmechanism through a Vigil Mechanism \\nand Whistle-blower Policy for reporting \\nand handling of such violations, termed \\nas ‘Reportable Matters’. Under this \\npolicy, the employees are encouraged \\nto report any such violations without \\nfear of retaliation. For easy access, the \\nVigil Mechanism and Whistle-blower \\nPolicy is hosted on the website of the \\nCompany. The whistle-blower can \\nmake a protected disclosure either to \\nthe Ethics and Compliance Task Force \\nor directly to the Audit Committee via \\ne-mail, telephone or letter without fear \\nof any reprisal.WAY FORWARD\\nReliance is leading the \\nmovement to build the next \\ngeneration of leaders who \\nwill significantly contribute \\nto the advancement of \\nIndia and the world. \\nThe Company aspires to \\nadvance its internal talent \\nmanagement system to \\naccelerate the development \\nof employees while ensuring \\ntheir overall emotional and \\nphysical wellbeing.

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \\nfinancial reporting\\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \\nas a key audit matter for the Company because its financial \\naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally \\nreliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant \\ntransaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and \\nraw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction \\nvolumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity \\nof the Company’s systems and data, cyber security has \\nbecome more significant. Automated accounting procedures \\nand IT environment controls, which include IT governance, \\nIT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations, IT application \\ncontrols and interfaces between IT applications, are required \\nto be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate \\nfinancial reporting.Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:\\n• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging \\nIT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and \\ninternal audit at the Company and identified IT applications \\nthat are relevant to our audit.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\n• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity at \\nthe Company in respect of the overall security architecture and \\nany key threats addressed by the Company in the current year.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT application controls in the key processes impacting \\nfinancial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof controls relating to data transmission through the different \\nIT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\nInformation Other than the Financial \\nStatements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\n• The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nother information. The other information comprises the \\ninformation included in the Annual Report, but does \\nnot include the Consolidated Financial Statements, \\nStandalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s \\nreport thereon.\\n• Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements \\ndoes not cover the other information and we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n• In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements, our responsibility is to read the other \\ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the \\nother information is materially inconsistent with the \\nStandalone Financial Statements, or our knowledge \\nobtained during the course of our audit or otherwise \\nappears to be materially misstated.\\n• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \\nthat there is a material misstatement of this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We have \\nnothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management and \\nThose Charged with Governance for the \\nStandalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \\nthe preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view of the financial position, \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive \\nincome, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting \\nprinciples generally accepted in India. This responsibility \\nalso includes maintenance of adequate accounting \\nrecords in accordance with the provisions of the Act for \\nsafeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing \\nand detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection \\nand application of appropriate accounting policies; \\nmaking judgments and estimates that are reasonable and \\nprudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of \\nadequate internal financial controls, that were operating \\neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness \\nof the accounting records, relevant to the preparation \\nand presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view and are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, \\nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Company’s \\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as \\napplicable, matters related to going concern and using \\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless the Board \\nof Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to \\ncease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \\nThe Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for \\noverseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of \\nthe Standalone Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually \\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the \\nbasis of these Standalone Financial Statements. \\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \\noverride of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control \\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section \\n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing \\nour opinion on whether the Company has adequate \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements in place and the operating \\neffectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \\nrelated disclosures made by the management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that \\nmay cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability \\nto continue as a going concern. If we conclude that \\na material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw \\nattention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures \\nin the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such \\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our \\nconclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained \\nup to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \\nevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease \\nto continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements, including the \\ndisclosures, an d whether the Standalone Financial \\nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieve s fair presentation.\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \\nStandalone Financial Statements that, individually or \\nin aggregate, makes it probable that the economic \\ndecisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the \\nStandalone Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative \\nfactors (i) in planning the scope of our audit work and in \\nevaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the \\neffect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone \\nFinancial Statements.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with \\na statement that we have complied with relevant \\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to \\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements of the current year and are therefore the key \\naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \\nwe determine that a matter should not be communicated \\nin our report because the adverse co nsequences of doing \\nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \\ninterest benefits of such communication.\\nOther Matter\\nThe Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for \\nthe year ended 31st March, 2022, prepared in accordance \\nwith Ind AS have been audited by the predecessor auditors. \\nThe report of the predecessor auditors dated 6th May, 2022, \\nexpressed an unmodified opinion.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory \\nRequirements\\n1.

A liability is current when:\\n  -  It is expected to be settled in normal \\noperating cycle;\\n  -  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n  -  There is no unconditional right to defer the \\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve \\nmonths after the reporting period.\\n   The Company classifies all other liabilities as \\nnon- current.\\n   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as \\nnon-current assets and liabilities.\\n (b) Property, Plant and Equipment\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at \\ncost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount \\nand rebates less accumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing cost and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets to \\nits working condition for its intended use, net \\ncharges on foreign exchange contracts and \\nadjustments arising from exchange rate variations \\nattributable to the assets. In case of land the \\nCompany has availed fair value as deemed cost \\non the date of transition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably.\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment which are \\nsignificant to the total cost of that item of \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and having \\ndifferent useful life are accounted separately.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to \\nproject, net of income earned during the project \\ndevelopment stage prior to its intended use, \\nare considered as pre-operative expenses and \\ndisclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\\n   Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment \\nis provided using written down value method \\non depreciable amount except in case of certain \\nassets of Oil to Chemicals and Other segment \\nwhich are depreciated using straight line method. \\nDepreciation is provided based on useful life of \\nthe assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 except in respect of the \\nfollowing assets, where useful life is different \\nthan those prescribed in Schedule II;Particular Depreciation\\nFixed Bed Catalyst (useful \\nlife: 2 years or more)Over its useful life as \\ntechnically assessed\\nFixed Bed Catalyst (useful \\nlife: up to 2 years)100% depreciated in the \\nyear of addition\\nPlant and Machinery (useful \\nlife: 25 to 50 years)Over its useful life as \\ntechnically assessed\\nBuildings (Useful life : 30 to \\n65 years)Over its useful life as \\ntechnically assessed\\n   The residual values, useful lives and methods of \\ndepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment \\nare reviewed at each financial year end and \\nadjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\\n   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment are measured as \\nthe difference between the net disposal proceeds \\nand the carrying amount of the asset and are \\nrecognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss \\nwhen the asset is derecognised.\\n (c) Leases\\n   The Company, as a lessee, recognises a \\nright-of-use asset and a lease liability for its \\nleasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the \\nright to\\xa0control the use of an identified asset.\\n   The contract conveys the right to control the \\nuse of an identified asset, if it involves the use \\nof an identified asset and the Company has \\nsubstantially all of the economic benefits from \\nuse of the asset and has right to direct the use \\nof the identified asset. The cost of the right-of-\\nuse asset shall comprise of the amount of the \\ninitial measurement of the lease liability adjusted \\nfor any lease payments made at or before the \\ncommencement date plus any initial direct costs \\nincurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently \\nmeasured at cost less any accumulated \\ndepreciation/ amortisation, accumulated \\nimpairment losses, if any and adjusted for any \\nremeasurement of the lease liability. The right-\\nof-use assets is depreciated/ amortised using the \\nstraight-line method from the commencement \\ndate over the shorter of lease term or useful life \\nof right-of-use asset.\\n   The Company measures the lease liability at \\nthe present value of the lease payments that \\nare not paid at the commencement date of \\nthe lease. The lease payments are discounted \\nusing the interest rate implicit in the lease, if \\nthat rate can be readily determined. If that rate \\ncannot be readily determined, the Company uses \\nincremental borrowing rate.\\n   For short-term and low value leases, the \\nCompany recognises the lease payments as an \\noperating expense on a straight-line basis over \\nthe lease term. (d) Intangible Assets\\n   Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition \\nnet of recoverable taxes, trade discount and \\nrebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion \\nand impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the asset to \\nits working condition for the intended use, \\nnet charges on foreign exchange contracts \\nand adjustments arising from exchange rate \\nvariations attributable to the Intangible Assets.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating \\nto project, net of income earned during \\nthe project development stage prior to its \\nintended use, are considered as pre-operative \\nexpenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nUnder Development.\\n   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an \\nIntangible Asset are measured as the difference \\nbetween the net disposal proceeds and the \\ncarrying amount of the asset and are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss when the \\nasset is derecognised.

Borrowing costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are capitalised as part of the \\ncost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that \\nnecessarily takes substantial period of time to get \\nready for its intended use.\\n   Interest income earned on the temporary \\ninvestment of specific borrowings pending \\ntheir expenditure on qualifying assets is \\ndeducted from the borrowing costs eligible \\nfor capitalisation.\\n   All other borrowing costs are charged to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss for the period for \\nwhich they are incurred.\\n (h) Inventories\\n   Items of inventories are measured at lower of \\ncost and net realisable value after providing \\nfor obsolescence, if any, except in case of \\nby-products which are valued at net realisable \\nvalue. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of \\npurchase, cost of conversion and other costs \\nincluding manufacturing overheads net of \\nrecoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to \\ntheir respective present location and condition.\\n   Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw \\nmaterials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are \\ndetermined on weighted average basis.\\n (i)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets \\n- Property, Plant and Equipment and \\nIntangible Assets\\n   The Company assesses at each reporting \\ndate as to whether there is any indication \\nthat any Property, Plant and Equipment and \\nIntangible Assets or group of Assets, called Cash \\nGenerating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any \\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount \\nof an asset or CGU is estimated to determine \\nthe extent of impairment, if any. When it is not \\npossible to estimate the recoverable amount of \\nan individual asset, the Company estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of the CGU to which the \\nasset belongs.\\n   An impairment loss is recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss to the extent, \\nasset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable \\namount. The recoverable amount is higher of an \\nasset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in \\nuse. Value in use is based on the estimated future \\ncash flows, discounted to their present value \\nusing pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \\nmarket assessments of the time value of money \\nand risk specific to the assets.\\n   The impairment loss recognised in prior \\naccounting period is reversed if there has been a \\nchange in the estimate of recoverable amount.\\n (j) Provisions\\n   Provisions are recognised when the Company \\nhas a present obligation (legal or constructive) \\nas a result of a past event, it is probable that \\nan outflow of resources embodying economic \\nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation \\nand a reliable estimate can be made of the \\namount of the obligation. If the effect of the \\ntime value of money is material, provisions are \\ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \\nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \\nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \\ntime is recognised as a finance cost.\\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Company records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding of \\ndiscount is recognised in the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss.\\n (k) Contingent Liabilities\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of \\none or more uncertain future events not wholly \\nwithin the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that arises from past events where it is \\neither not probable that an outflow of resources \\nembodying economic benefits will be required \\nto settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot \\nbe made.\\n (l) Employee Benefits Expense\\n  Short-Term Employee Benefits\\n   The undiscounted amount of short-term \\nemployee benefits expected to be paid in \\nexchange for the services rendered by employees \\nare recognised as an expense during the period \\nwhen the employees render the services.\\n  Post-Employment Benefits\\n  Defined Contribution Plans\\n   The Company recognises contribution payable \\nto the provident fund scheme as an expense, \\nwhen an employee renders the related service. \\nIf the contribution payable to the scheme for \\nservice received before the balance sheet date \\nexceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit \\npayable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. \\nIf the contribution already paid exceeds the \\ncontribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date, then excess is recognised \\nas an asset to the extent that the pre-payment \\nwill lead to a reduction in future payment or a \\ncash refund.\\n  Defined Benefit Plans\\n   The Company pays gratuity to the employees \\nwho have completed five years of service \\nwith the Company at the time of resignation/\\nsuperannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days \\nbasic salary for every completed year of service \\nas per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The \\ngratuity liability amount is contributed to the \\napproved gratuity fund formed exclusively for \\ngratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity \\nfund has been approved by respective Income \\nTax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity \\nand other post-employment benefits is calculated \\nusing the Projected Unit Credit Method and spread over the period during which the benefit is \\nexpected to be derived from employees’ services.\\n   Remeasurement gains and losses arising \\nfrom adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in \\nthe period in which they occur in Other \\nComprehensive Income.\\n   Employee Separation Costs:  The Company \\nrecognises the employee separation cost when \\nthe scheme is announced, and the Company is \\ndemonstrably committed to it.\\n (m) Tax Expenses\\n   The tax expenses for the period comprises of \\ncurrent tax and deferred income tax. Tax is \\nrecognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, \\nexcept to the extent that it relates to items \\nrecognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. \\nIn which case, the tax is also recognised in Other \\nComprehensive Income.\\n  i. Current Tax\\n    Current tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the amount expected to be \\nrecovered from or paid to the Income Tax \\nauthorities, based on tax rates and laws that \\nare enacted at the Balance sheet date.\\n  ii. Deferred Tax\\n    Deferred tax is recognised on temporary \\ndifferences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities in the Financial \\nStatements and the corresponding tax bases \\nused in the computation of taxable profit.\\n    Deferred tax assets are recognised to \\nthe extent it is probable that taxable \\nprofit will be available against which the \\ndeductible temporary differences, and the \\ncarry forward of unused tax losses can be \\nutilised. Deferred tax liabilities and assets \\nare measured at the tax rates that are \\nexpected to apply in the period in which \\nthe liability is settled or the asset realised, \\nbased on tax rates (and tax laws) that have \\nbeen enacted or substantively enacted \\nby the end of the reporting period. The \\ncarrying amount of Deferred tax liabilities \\nand assets are reviewed at the end of each \\nreporting period.\\n (n) Share Based Payments\\n   Equity-settled share based payments to \\nemployees and others providing similar services \\nare measured at the fair value of the equity \\ninstruments at the grant date. Details regarding \\nthe determination of the fair value of equity-Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n330 331\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23settled share based payments transactions are \\nset out in Note 29.2.\\n   The fair value determined at the grant date \\nof the equity-settled share based payments is \\nexpensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting \\nperiod, based on the Company’s estimate of \\nequity instruments that will eventually vest, \\nwith a corresponding increase in equity. At the \\nend of each reporting period, the Company \\nrevises its estimate of the number of equity \\ninstruments expected to vest. The impact of \\nthe revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such \\nthat the cumulative expenses reflects the revised \\nestimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the \\nShare Based Payments Reserve.\\n   The dilutive effect of outstanding options is \\nreflected as additional share dilution in the \\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share.\\n   In case of Group equity-settled share-based \\npayment transactions, where the Company \\ngrants stock options to the employees of its \\nsubsidiaries, the transactions are accounted by \\nincreasing the cost of investment in subsidiary \\nwith a corresponding credit in the equity.\\n (o)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded \\nat the exchange rate prevailing on the date \\nof transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated \\nat the functional currency closing rates of \\nexchange at the reporting date. Exchange \\ndifferences arising on settlement or translation of \\nmonetary items are recognised in Statement of \\nProfit and Loss except to the extent of exchange \\ndifferences which are regarded as an adjustment \\nto interest costs on foreign currency borrowings \\nthat are directly attributable to the acquisition \\nor construction of qualifying assets which \\nare capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, \\nexchange gains or losses on foreign currency \\nborrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which \\nare related to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost \\nof such assets.\\n   Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are \\nrecorded using the exchange rates at the date of \\nthe transaction. Non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value in a foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rates at the date when the \\nfair value was measured. The gain or loss arising \\non translation of non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value is treated in line with the recognition \\nof the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items \\nwhose fair value gain or loss is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income or Statement \\nof Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other \\nComprehensive Income or Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, respectively).\\n   In case of an asset, expense or income where a \\nnon-monetary advance is paid/received, the date \\nof transaction is the date on which the advance \\nwas initially recognised. If there were multiple \\npayments or receipts in advance, multiple dates \\nof transactions are determined for each payment \\nor receipt of advance consideration.\\n (p) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is \\nrecognised when control of the goods or \\nservices are transferred to the customer at an \\namount that reflects the consideration entitled \\nin exchange for those goods or services. The \\nCompany is generally the principal as it typically \\ncontrols the goods or services before transferring \\nthem to the customer.\\n   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment \\nof goods to the customer or when the goods \\nis made available to the customer, provided \\ntransfer of title to the customer occurs and the \\nCompany has not retained any significant risks of \\nownership or future obligations with respect to \\nthe goods shipped.\\n   Revenue from rendering of services is recognised \\nover time by measuring the progress towards \\ncomplete satisfaction of performance obligations \\nat the reporting period.\\n   Revenue is measured at the amount of \\nconsideration which the Company expects to be \\nentitled to in exchange for transferring distinct \\ngoods or services to a customer as specified in \\nthe contract, excluding amounts collected on \\nbehalf of third parties (for example taxes and \\nduties collected on behalf of the government). \\nConsideration is generally due upon satisfaction \\nof performance obligations and a receivable \\nis recognised when it becomes unconditional. \\nGenerally, the credit period varies between 0-60 \\ndays from the shipment or delivery of goods \\nor services as the case may be. The Company \\nprovides volume rebates to certain customers \\nonce the quantity of products purchased during \\nthe period exceeds a threshold specified and \\nalso accrues discounts to certain customers \\nbased on customary business practices which \\nis derived on the basis of crude price volatility \\nand various market demand – supply situations. \\nConsideration are determined based on its most \\nlikely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum \\nproducts contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on \\nprovisional price.\\n   Difference between final settlement price and \\nprovisional price is recognised subsequently. The \\nCompany does not adjust short-term advances \\nreceived from the customer for the effects of \\nsignificant financing component if it is expected \\nat the contract inception that the promised good \\nor service will be transferred to the customer \\nwithin a period of one year.\\n  Contract Balances\\n  Trade Receivables\\n   A receivable represents the Company’s right to \\nan amount of consideration that is unconditional.\\n  Contract Liabilities\\n   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer \\ngoods or services to a customer for which \\nthe Company has received consideration or \\nis due from the customer. If a customer pays \\nconsideration before the Company transfers \\ngoods or services to the customer, a contract \\nliability is recognised when the payment is made \\nor the payment is due (whichever is earlier).\\n   Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue \\nwhen the Company performs under the contract.\\n  Interest Income\\n   Interest Income from a Financial Assets is \\nrecognised using effective interest rate method.\\n  Dividend Income\\n   Dividend Income is recognised when the \\nCompany’s right to receive the amount has \\nbeen established.\\n (q) Financial Instruments\\n  i.  Financial Assets\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All Financial Assets are initially recognised at \\nfair value. Transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nFinancial Assets, which are not at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the \\nfair value on initial recognition. Purchase \\nand sale of Financial Assets are recognised \\nusing trade date accounting. However, trade \\nreceivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at \\ntransaction price.  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n   a)  Financial Assets measured at \\nAmortised Cost (AC)\\n     A Financial Asset is measured at \\nAmortised Cost if it is held within a \\nbusiness model whose objective is \\nto hold the asset in order to collect \\ncontractual cash flows and the \\ncontractual terms of the Financial Asset \\ngive rise to cash flows on specified \\ndates that represent solely payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n   b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair \\nValue Through Other Comprehensive \\nIncome (FVTOCI)\\n     A Financial Asset is measured at \\nFVTOCI if it is held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by \\nboth collecting contractual cash flows \\nand selling Financial Assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the Financial Asset \\ngive rise on specified dates to cash \\nflows that represents solely payments \\nof principal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n   c)  Financial Assets measured at \\nFair Value Through Profit or Loss \\n(FVTPL)\\n     A Financial Asset which is not classified \\nin any of the above categories are \\nmeasured at FVTPL. Financial assets \\nare reclassified subsequent to their \\nrecognition, if the Company changes \\nits business model for managing \\nthose financial assets. Changes in \\nbusiness model are made and applied \\nprospectively from the reclassification \\ndate following the changes in business \\nmodel in accordance with principles \\nlaid down under Ind AS 109 – \\nFinancial Instruments.\\n  C.  Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and \\nJoint Ventures\\n    The Company has accounted for its \\ninvestments in Subsidiaries, associates and \\njoint venture at cost less impairment loss (if \\nany). The investments in preference shares \\nwith the right of surplus assets which are \\nin nature of equity in accordance with Ind \\nAS 32 are treated as separate category of \\ninvestment and measured at FVTOCI.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n332 333\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  D. Other Equity Investments\\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Statement of Profit and Loss, except \\nfor those equity investments for which \\nthe Company has elected to present the \\nvalue changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \\nIncome’. However, dividend on such equity \\ninvestments are recognised in Statement of \\nProfit and loss when the\\xa0Company’s right to \\nreceive payment is established.\\n  E. Impairment of Financial Assets\\n    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the \\nCompany uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ \\n(ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of \\nFinancial Assets other than those measured \\nat Fair Value Through Profit and Loss \\n(FVTPL).\\n    Expected Credit Losses are measured \\nthrough a loss allowance at an amount \\nequal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or\\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from all \\npossible default events over the life of the \\nfinancial instrument).\\n    For Trade Receivables the Company \\napplies ‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables.\\n    The Company uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Company uses 12 \\nmonth ECL to provide for impairment loss \\nwhere there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in \\ncredit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All Financial Liabilities are recognised at \\nfair value and in case of borrowings, net of \\ndirectly attributable cost. Fees of recurring \\nnature are directly recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. For \\ntrade and other payables maturing within \\none year from the balance sheet date, the \\ncarrying amounts approximate fair value due \\nto the short maturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Company uses various derivative \\nfinancial instruments such as interest \\nrate swaps, currency swaps, forwards \\n& options and commodity contracts to \\nmitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, \\nexchange rates and commodity prices. \\nAt the inception of a hedge relationship, \\nthe Company formally designates and \\ndocuments the hedge relationship to \\nwhich the Company wishes to apply hedge \\naccounting and the risk management \\nobjective and strategy for undertaking the \\nhedge. Such derivative financial instruments \\nare initially recognised at fair value on \\nthe date on which a derivative contract \\nis entered into and are also subsequently \\nmeasured at fair value.\\n    Derivatives are carried as Financial Assets \\nwhen the fair value is positive and as \\nFinancial Liabilities when the fair value is \\nnegative. Any gains or losses arising from \\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives are \\ntaken directly to Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, except for the effective portion of \\ncash flow hedge which is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income and later \\nto Statement of Profit and Loss when the \\nhedged item affects profit or loss or is \\ntreated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in \\nthe recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or \\nNon-Financial liability.\\n    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows:\\n  A. Cash Flow Hedge\\n    The Company designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments \\nto mitigate the risk of movement in \\ninterest rates and foreign exchange rates \\nfor foreign exchange exposure on highly \\nprobable future cash flows attributable to \\na recognised asset or liability or forecast \\ncash transactions.\\n    When a derivative is designated as a cash \\nflow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of \\nthe derivative is recognised in the cash \\nflow hedging reserve being part of Other \\nComprehensive Income. Any ineffective \\nportion of changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative is recognised immediately in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging \\nrelationship no longer meets the criteria for \\nhedge accounting, then hedge accounting \\nis discontinued prospectively. If the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold or terminated \\nor exercised, the cumulative gain or loss \\non the hedging instrument recognised in \\ncash flow hedging reserve till the period \\nthe hedge was effective remains in cash \\nflow hedging reserve until the underlying \\ntransaction occurs. The cumulative gain \\nor loss previously recognised in the cash \\nflow hedging reserve is transferred to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss upon the \\noccurrence of the underlying transaction. \\nIf the forecasted transaction is no longer \\nexpected to occur, then the amount \\naccumulated in cash flow hedging reserve \\nis reclassified in the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss.\\n  B. Fair Value Hedge\\n    The Company designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets/Liabilities as hedging instruments \\nto mitigate the risk of change in fair value \\nof hedged item due to movement in \\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates and \\ncommodity prices.\\n    Changes in the fair value of hedging \\ninstruments and hedged items that are \\ndesignated and qualify as fair value hedges \\nare recorded in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. If the hedging relationship no longer \\nmeets the criteria for hedge accounting, \\nthe adjustment to the carrying amount of a \\nhedged item for which the effective interest \\nmethod is used is amortised to Statement of \\nProfit and Loss over the period of maturity.\\n  iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\\n    The Company derecognises a Financial \\nAsset when the contractual rights to the \\ncash flows from the Financial Asset expire \\nor it transfers the Financial Asset and the \\ntransfer qualifies for derecognition under \\nInd AS 109. A Financial liability (or a part \\nof a Financial liability) is derecognised \\nfrom the Company’s Balance Sheet when \\nthe obligation specified in the contract is \\ndischarged or cancelled or expires.  v.  Offsetting\\n    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe balance sheet when, and only when, the \\nCompany has a legally enforceable right to \\nset off the amount and it intends, either to \\nsettle them on a net basis or to realise the \\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\n (r) Non-current Assets Held for Sale\\n   Non-current assets are classified as held for \\nsale if their carrying amount will be recovered \\nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than \\nthrough continuing use and sale is considered \\nhighly probable.\\n   A sale is considered as highly probable when \\ndecision has been made to sell, assets are \\navailable for immediate sale in its present \\ncondition, assets are being actively marketed \\nand sale has been agreed or is expected to \\nbe concluded within 12 months of the date \\nof classification.\\n   Non-current assets held for sale are neither \\ndepreciated nor amortised.\\n   Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are \\nmeasured at the lower of their carrying amount \\nand fair value less cost of disposal and are \\npresented separately in the Balance Sheet.\\n (s) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   The Company has adopted Successful Efforts \\nMethod (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas \\nactivities. The policy of recognition of exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure is considered in \\nline with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, \\ngeological and geophysical studies, petroleum \\nexploration license fees and general and \\nadministration costs directly attributable to \\nexploration and evaluation activities are expensed \\noff. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest \\nin oil and gas blocks and on exploration and \\nevaluation other than those which are expensed \\noff are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under \\nDevelopment. All development costs incurred \\nin respect of proved reserves are also capitalised \\nunder Intangible Assets Under Development. \\nOnce a well is ready to commence commercial \\nproduction, the costs accumulated in Intangible \\nAssets Under Development are classified as \\nIntangible Assets corresponding to proved \\ndeveloped oil and gas reserves. The exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure which does not result \\nin discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all \\ncost pertaining to production are charged to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n334 335\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23   The Company uses technical estimation of \\nreserves as per the Petroleum Resources \\nManagement System guidelines 2011 and \\nstandard geological and reservoir engineering \\nmethods. The reserve review and evaluation is \\ncarried out annually.\\n   Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature \\nof joint operations. Accordingly, assets and \\nliabilities as well as income and expenditure are \\naccounted on the basis of available information \\non a line-by-line basis with similar items in the \\nCompany’s Financial Statements, according to \\nthe participating interest of the Company.\\n (t) Earnings Per Share\\n   Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing \\nthe net profit after tax by the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the \\nyear adjusted for bonus element in equity share. \\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures \\nused in determination of basic earnings per share \\nto take into account the conversion of all dilutive \\npotential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity \\nshares are deemed converted as at the beginning \\nof the period unless issued at a later date.\\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements\\xa0and \\nKey Sources Of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Company’s Financial \\nStatements requires management to make \\njudgement, estimates and assumptions that affect \\nthe reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets \\nand liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. \\nUncertainty about these assumptions and estimates \\ncould result in outcomes that require a material \\nadjustment to the carrying amount of assets or \\nliabilities affected in next financial years.\\n(A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Company’s estimates of \\nits oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases \\nit’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement \\nof reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and \\ncommercial assessments based on conventional \\nindustry practice and regulatory requirements.\\n  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used \\nto calculate depletion charges for the Company’s \\noil and gas properties. The impact of changes in \\nestimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the \\nasset over the expected future production. Oil and \\nnatural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the \\nassessment of the recoverability of asset carrying \\nvalues reported in the Financial Statements.\\n  Details on proved reserves and production both \\non product and geographical basis are provided in \\nNote\\xa036.2.\\n(B) Decommissioning Liabilities\\n  The liability for decommissioning costs is recognised \\nwhen the Company has an obligation to perform site \\nrestoration activity. The recognition and measurement \\nof decommissioning provisions involves the use of \\nestimates and assumptions. These include; the timing \\nof abandonment of well and related facilities which \\nwould depend upon the ultimate life of the field, \\nexpected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied \\nfor discounting.\\n(C)  Property Plant and Equipment/Intangible \\nAssets\\n  Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating \\nin the manner intended by the management. \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are \\ndepreciated/amortised over their estimated useful \\nlife, after taking into account estimated residual \\nvalue. Management reviews the estimated useful life \\nand residual values of the assets annually in order to \\ndetermine the amount of depreciation/ amortisation \\nto be recorded during any reporting period. The \\nuseful life and residual values are based on the \\nCompany’s historical experience with similar assets \\nand take into account anticipated technological and \\nfuture risks. The depreciation/amortisation for future \\nperiods is revised if there are significant changes from \\nprevious estimates.\\n(D)  Recoverability of Trade Receivables\\n  Judgments are required in assessing the recoverability \\nof overdue trade receivables and determining whether \\na provision against those receivables is required. \\nFactors considered include the credit rating of the \\ncounterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated \\nfuture payments and any possible actions that can be \\ntaken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\\n(E) Provisions\\n  The timing of recognition and quantification of the \\nliability (including litigations) requires the application \\nof judgement to existing facts and circumstances, \\nwhich can be subject to change. The carrying \\namounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing \\nfacts and circumstances.\\n(F)  Impairment of Financial and \\nNon-Financial Assets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \\nare based on assumptions about risk of default \\nand expected cash loss rates. The Company uses \\njudgement in making these assumptions and \\nselecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, \\nbased on Company’s past history, existing market \\nconditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the \\nend of each reporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets, assessment of \\nimpairment indicators involves consideration of \\nfuture risks. Further, the company estimates asset’s \\nrecoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or \\nCash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of \\ndisposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using \\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \\nspecific to the asset. In determining fair value less \\ncosts of disposal, recent market transactions are taken \\ninto account, if no such transactions can be identified, \\nan appropriate valuation model is used.\\n(G)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and \\nLiabilities\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses for \\nwhich there is probability of utilisation against the \\nfuture taxable profit. The Company uses judgement \\nto determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level \\nof future taxable profits and business developments.\\n(H) Fair Value Measurement\\n  For estimates relating to fair value of financial \\ninstruments refer note 39 of financial statements.\\nD.

The above information \\nis certified by the actuary.\\nThe Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the \\ncomposition of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Company’s policy for \\nPlan Assets Management.\\n  VII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with FY 2022-23.\\n  VIII) Sensitivity Analysis\\n    Significant Actuarial Assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected \\nsalary increase and employee turnover. The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably \\npossible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions \\nconstant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:\\nAs at 31st March, 2023 As at 31st March, 2022\\nDecrease Increase Decrease Increase\\nChange in rate of discounting (delta effect of +/- 0.5%) 21 22 24 26\\nChange in rate of salary increase (delta effect of -/+ 0.5%) 22 23 25 26\\nChange in rate of employee turnover (delta effect of -/+ \\n0.5%)2 2 2 2    These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and \\nSalary Risk.\\nInvestment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is \\ndetermined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\\nInterest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset \\nby an increase in the return on the plan\\'s debt investments.\\nLongevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate \\nof the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life \\nexpectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan\\'s liability.\\nSalary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan \\nparticipants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan\\'s liability.\\n 29.2 Share Based Payments\\n  a) Scheme details\\n    The Company has Employees’ Stock Option Scheme i.e. ESOS-2017 under which options have been granted at the \\nexercise price of C 10 per share to be vested from time to time on the basis of performance and other eligibility criteria. \\nDetails of number of options outstanding have been tabulated below: \\nFinancial Year\\n(Year of Grant)Number of Options Outstanding\\nFinancial Year of VestingExercise  \\nPrice ( K)Range of Fair value at \\nGrant Date ( K)As at  \\n31st March 2023As at  \\n31st March 2022\\nESOS - 2017\\nDetails of Employee Stock Options granted from 1st April, 2020 to 31st March, 2023\\n2020-21 2,00,000 3,00,000 2021-22 to 2024-25 10.00 2,133.40 -2,151.90\\n2021-22 90,000 90,000 2022-23 to 2025-26 10.00 2,595.20-2,613.30\\nTotal 2,90,000 3,90,000\\nExercise period would commence from the date of Vesting and would expire not later than seven years from the Grant \\nDate or such other period as may be decided by the Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee of \\nthe Board.\\n  b) Fair Value on the grant date\\n    The fair value at grant date is determined using “Black Scholes Model” which takes into account the exercise price, \\nterm of the option, share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying shares, expected dividend \\nyield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.\\n    The model inputs for options granted during the year ended 31st March, 2021 and 31st March, 2022 included as \\nmentioned below.\\n            ESOS - 2017\\na) Weighted average exercise price C 10 C 10\\nb) Grant date: 05.10.2020 30.03.2022\\nc) Vesting year: 2021-22 to 2024-25 2022-23 to 2025-26\\nd) Share Price at grant date: C 2,212 C 2,673\\ne) Expected price volatility of Company\\'s share: 30.2% to 31.9% 30.7% to 33%\\nf) Expected dividend yield: 0.60% 0.49%\\ng) Risk free interest rate: 5.1% to 5.6% 5.86% to 6.34%\\nThe expected price volatility is based on the historic volatility (based on remaining life of the options).Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n364 365\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  c) Movement in share options during the year:\\nAs at 31st March, 2023 As at 31st March, 2022\\nNumber of share \\noptionsWeighted average \\nexercise priceNumber of share \\noptionsWeighted average \\nexercise price\\nBalance at the beginning of the year 3,90,000 10.00 42,25,200 13.14\\nGranted during the year - - 90,000 10.00\\nExercised during the year (1,00,000) 10.00 (39,25,200) 13.38\\nBalance at the end of the year 2,90,000 10.00 3,90,000 10.00\\nWeighted average remaining contractual life of the share option outstanding at the end of year is 1,817 days (Previous \\nYear 2,138 days).\\n(C in crore)\\n2022-23 2021-22\\n30.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the \\nterms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined \\nin the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI \\nof $\\xa0165 million ( C 1,353 crore) being the Company`s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,029 crore) towards additional \\nProfit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023. \\nThe next date of hearing is awaited.   In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified \\nthe New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to \\ninstruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under \\nthe guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be \\ncredited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool \\nAccount is C 295 crore (net) as at 31st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in \\nrespect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been \\nchallenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\\n 36.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately \\nUS$ 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on \\nbehalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair \\nclaim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an appeal \\non 15th\\xa0November, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the \\nFinal Award of the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the \\nArbitration Award dated 24th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI’s appeal.\\n  (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) \\nagainst GOI on 16th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts (‘PSCs’) for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks \\ndue to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by \\nmajority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, \\n2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on \\n16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral \\nTribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1st October, 2018 (‘2018 \\nFPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English \\nCommercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ challenge in February 2020 and \\nremitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable \\naward on 29th January, 2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case Award”). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements \\nCase Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application \\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral \\nTribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which \\nwill take place post determination of Claimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs. \\n    GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the \\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and \\nexecution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The \\nClaimants contend that GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government’s Execution Petition \\nbefore the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon’ble Court ruled that Government of India’s execution petition seeking \\nenforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal’s Final Partial Award dated 12th October, 2016 (“2016 FPA”) \\nrelating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.\\n  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for \\na\\xa0period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses \\nin the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\\n    Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible \\nexposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ \\nlitigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\\n 36.5 Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources\\n   The following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to \\nactivity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticularsAs at  \\n31st March, 2023As at  \\n31st March, 2022\\nExploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost\\nExploration Expenditure written off - 102\\nOther Exploration Cost 4 79\\nExploration Cost for the year 4 181Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n388 389\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23(C in crore)\\n2022-23 2021-22\\n37.

By an \\norder dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the \\n‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the order; and \\n(ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 till \\nthe date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) \\nagainst this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL to pay the disgorged \\namount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other noticees has been admitted by the Hon’ble \\nSupreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 \\ncrore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of \\ninterest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17, 2020 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. \\nIn the very same matter, on November 21, 2017, SEBI issued show cause notice, inter alia, to RIL, asking RIL to show cause as to \\nwhy inquiry should not be held in terms of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) \\nRules, 1995 and penalty not be imposed under the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. The \\nAdjudicating Officer of SEBI passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL.

Financial Risk Management\\n   The company’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. \\nWithin the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Company uses derivative instruments to \\nmanage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance.\\n  i) Market Risk\\n    Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes \\nin market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as \\nequity price risk and commodity risk.\\n   a) Foreign Currency Risk\\n     Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign currency rates.

The company has \\na\\xa0risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and \\nfreight costs.\\n    The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. \\nIn accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses \\nover-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight \\nexposure.\\n  iii) Credit Risk\\n    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due \\ncausing financial loss to the company. Credit risk arises from company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives \\nand receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate \\ncreditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit \\ninformation is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify \\nand respond to cases of credit deterioration.\\n    The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, \\nadvance payments and factoring & forfeiting without recourse to the company to avoid concentration of risk. The \\ncompany restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.  iv) Liquidity Risk\\n    Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company \\nmaintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global \\nand local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to \\nensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts \\nof the company’s cash flow position and ensures that the company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times \\nincluding contingencies.\\n    The company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. \\nTreasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net \\ndeficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank \\ndeposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified \\nto\\xa0avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars ^Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current *@12,633 7,389 24,053 56,150 21,040 59,234 1,80,499\\nCurrent $33,985 2,387 - - - - 36,372\\nTotal 46,618 9,776 24,053 56,150 21,040 59,234 2,16,871\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 81 81 161 587 552 4,301 5,763\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 645 389 314 71 4 - 1,423\\nOptions 103 20 63 35 - - 221\\nInterest Rate Swaps 3 13 44 38 46 3 147\\nTotal 751 422 421 144 50 3 1,791\\n^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) C 1,10,722 crore.\\n* Include C 1,048 crore as Prepaid Financial Charges and fair valuation impact.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.2).\\n$ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 5.6% to 8.5%.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars ^Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current *@2,169 6,416 9,517 74,969 32,724 60,399 1,86,194\\nCurrent #$9,328 90 - - - - 9,418\\nTotal 11,497 6,506 9,517 74,969 32,724 60,399 1,95,612\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 85 79 148 552 552 4,577 5,993\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 3,033 601 677 390 - - 4,701\\nOptions 151 2 20 - - - 173\\nInterest Rate Swaps - - 4 43 30 - 77\\nTotal 3,184 603 701 433 30 - 4,951\\n^  Does not include Trade Payables (Current) C 1,34,005 crore.\\n* Include C 1,029 crore as Prepaid Financial Charges.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon.\\n# Include C 20 crore of Commercial Paper Discount.\\n$ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 2.5% to 8.6%.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nStandalone\\nNOTES  \\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n394 395\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 C. Hedge Accounting\\n   The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and \\nother feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a \\nstructured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting \\nframework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and \\noptions, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established \\na hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical \\nderivative method and critical term matching method.\\n  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. \\n  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n  Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\\n  A.

Our \\nresponsibilities under those Standards are further described \\nin the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. \\nWe are independent of the Group, its associates and joint \\nventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued \\nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) \\ntogether with the ethical requirements that are relevant to \\nour audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, \\nand we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in \\naccordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code \\nof Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by \\nus and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in \\nterms of their reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) \\nand (b) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our \\nprofessional judgment, were of most significance in our \\naudit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the \\ncurrent year. These matters were addressed in the context \\nof our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as \\na whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do \\nnot provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have \\ndetermined the matters described below to be the key \\naudit matters to be communicated in our report.\\nSr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n1.Estimates of Oil and Gas Reserves\\nSignificant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating \\noil and gas reserves which require consideration of factors \\nsuch as the availability of geological and engineering data, \\nreservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells and commodity prices. The quantum of \\noil and gas reserves have a direct impact on determination of \\ndepletion charge for the Parent\\'s oil and gas assets and on \\nthe assessment of the recoverability of the carrying values of \\ndevelopment rights. \\nAccordingly, the estimation of oil and gas reserves has been \\nconsidered as a key audit matter in view of the significant \\njudgements and estimates involved. \\nRefer Notes B.3 (e) and C(A) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the \\nfollowing:-\\n• Performed walk-through of the estimation process \\nassociated with the oil and gas reserves. Tested the design, \\nimplementation and operating effectiveness of the controls \\nestablished by the Parent  in the process of estimation of oil and \\ngas reserves.\\n• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent\\'s  \\ninternal specialists involved in estimating oil and gas reserves.\\n• Performed substantive testing of the depletion computation. \\nInvolved internal specialists to assess the reasonableness of \\nvaluation assumptions and appropriateness of the valuation \\nmethodology used in assessing the recoverability of the \\ncarrying value of exploration and evaluation assets included in \\nintangible assets under development.\\n• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent  in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for compliance with the \\napplicable authoritative pronouncements.Sr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n2.Depreciation / amortisation of spectrum and related \\ntangible assets\\nThe auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), a \\nstep-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported a key audit \\nmatter on amortization / depreciation of spectrum costs and \\nrelated tangible assets. Spectrum costs and the related tangible \\nassets are amortised / depreciated to appropriately reflect the \\nexpected pattern of consumption of expected future economic \\nbenefits from continued use of the said assets. Determination \\nof rate of amortisation / depreciation involves significant \\njudgement and estimates and use of technology. Accordingly, \\nit has been considered as a key audit matter. \\nRefer Notes B.3 (e) and C(C) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors of \\nRJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by \\nthe auditors of RJIL to address the key audit matter. As reported \\nby the subsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been \\nperformed by them:-\\n• Tested design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof controls over determination of expected economic benefits \\nfrom the use of relevant assets and monitoring actual \\nconsumption thereof to true-up the expected pattern of \\nconsumption during an accounting period.\\n• Involved internal Telecom and IT specialists to assess the \\nreasonableness of the expected pattern of consumption \\nof the expected economic benefits emanating from the \\nuse of the relevant assets and the IT environment over the \\nrelevant application systems used in monitoring the actual \\nconsumption thereof.\\n• Substantive testing procedures included, verifying the \\nmathematical accuracy of computation of amortisation /\\ndepreciation charge for the year.\\n3.Litigation matters\\nThe Parent has certain significant ongoing legal proceedings \\nfor various complex matters with the Government of India and \\nother parties, continuing from earlier years, which are as under:\\n1. Matters in relation to Oil and Gas:\\n (a)  Disallowance of certain costs under the production \\nsharing contract, relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 \\nand consequent deposit of differential revenue on \\ngas sales from D1D3 field to the gas pool account \\nmaintained by Gail (India) Limited. \\n (b)   Claim against the Parent in respect of gas said to \\nhave migrated from neighbouring blocks (KGD6).\\n (c)   Claims relating to limits of cost recovery, profit \\nsharing and audit and accounting provisions of the \\npublic sector corporations etc., arising under two \\nproduction sharing contracts entered into in 1994. \\n (d)   Suit for specific performance of a contract for \\nsupply of natural gas before the Hon’ble Bombay \\nHigh Court. \\n  Refer Notes 35.3 and 35.4 to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n2.   Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance \\nPetroleum Limited (‘RPL’):\\n  Securities Appellate Tribunal judgement dated November \\n5, 2020, dismissing the Parent\\'s  appeal made in relation \\nto Order passed by the Securities and Exchange Board \\nof India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 \\nin connection with trades by the Parent in the stock \\nexchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum \\nLimited, then subsidiary of the Parent.\\n  Refer Note 36 (III) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, \\nmanagement’s judgement regarding recognition, \\nmeasurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal \\nproceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over \\ntime as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.\\n Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the \\nfollowing:-\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof the controls established by the Parent  in the process of \\nevaluation of litigation matters.\\n• Assessed the management’s position through discussions \\nwith the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions \\nobtained by the Parent  (where considered necessary) on both, \\nthe probability of success in the aforesaid cases, and the \\nmagnitude of any potential loss.\\n• Discussed with the management on the developments in \\nrespect of these litigations during the year ended 31st March \\n2023 till the date of approval of the Parent\\'s Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n• Rolled out enquiry letters to the Parent\\'s  legal counsel and \\nassessed the responses received.\\n• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent\\'s  legal \\ncounsel involved in the process.\\n• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent  in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n• Obtained Management Representation Letter on the \\nassessment of these matters.\\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\n402 403\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23CONSOLIDATED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\\nSr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n4.Fair Valuation of Investments\\nAs at 31st March 2023, the Parent has investments of  C 78,093 \\ncrore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital Fibre \\nPrivate Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair value as \\nper Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.\\nThese investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair \\nvalue hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination \\nof fair value is based on a high degree of judgement and input \\nfrom data that is not directly observable in the market. Further, \\nthe fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern \\nof future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets). \\nAccordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter. \\nRefer Notes 2 and 38A to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:-\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof the controls established by the Parent in the process of \\ndetermination of fair value of the investments.\\n• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the \\nmanagement by involvement of internal valuation specialists.\\n• Assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts \\nincluding discount rates, expected growth rates and its \\neffect on business and terminal growth rates used and the \\nvaluation methodology inter-alia through involvement of the \\ninternal specialists.\\n• Discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared \\nto previous year / actual performance with management \\nto evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash \\nflow forecasts.\\n• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal \\nspecialist and Parent ’s external experts involved in the process.\\n• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent  in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n• Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards the \\nfair valuation of these investments.\\n5.Revenue Recognition\\n(a)  The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), \\na step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported \\nrevenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high \\nvolumes of data processed by the IT systems and the \\ncomplexity of those IT systems.In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors \\nof RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed \\nby them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the \\nsubsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been performed \\nby them:-\\n• Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and \\noperating effectiveness of the relevant business process \\ncontrols, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement \\nand authorization of revenue transactions, involving internal \\nInformation Technology (IT) specialists for the automated \\ncontrols, interface controls and reports generated through \\nvarious relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.\\n• Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment \\ninter-alia for access controls, change management and \\napplication specific controls in the IT Systems over the \\nCompany\\'s billing and other relevant support systems.\\n• Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue \\nper the billing system and the financial records. Performed \\nprocedures to test the computation of revenue and \\ndeferred revenue.\\n(b)  The auditors of Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’), a step-\\ndown subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue \\nrecognition as a key audit matter. RRL is engaged in \\norganised retail and the trading transactions generating \\nrevenue comprise of high volume of individually small \\ntransactions which increases the risk of revenue being \\nrecognised inappropriately and which highlights the \\ncriticality of sound internal processes of summarising \\nand recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption \\nbaskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of \\nconsideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised \\non transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. \\nTransfer of control coincides with collection of cash or \\ncash equivalent from customers. In view of the above \\nand since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, \\nrevenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \\nRRL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by \\nthem to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary \\nauditors, the following procedure have been performed by them:-\\n• Obtained understanding of the process followed by the \\nmanagement to record the revenue from each store.\\n• Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of \\nthe internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of \\nrevenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.\\n• Involved information technology specialist to test the \\nautomated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation \\nof revenue.\\n• On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various \\ndates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue recorded \\nthrough various modes of payment from RRL’s accounting \\nsystem. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such details with \\nthe underlying collection made by RRL as per cash receipts, \\nmerchant payment reports, and other third party supporting.Sr. \\nNo.Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\n6.Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \\nfinancial reporting\\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \\nas a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial \\naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant on \\nIT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction \\nvolumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material \\nconsumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and \\nthe increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Parent’s \\nsystems and data, cyber security has become more significant. \\nAutomated accounting procedures and IT environment \\ncontrols, which include IT governance, IT general controls over \\nprogram development and changes, access to program and \\ndata and IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces \\nbetween IT applications, are required to be designed and to \\noperate effectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:-\\n• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging \\nIT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and \\ninternal audit at the Parent and identified IT applications that \\nare relevant to our audit.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\n• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity \\nat the Parent  in respect of the overall security architecture and \\nany key threats addressed by the Parent  in the current year.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT application controls in the key processes impacting \\nfinancial reporting of the Parent by engaging IT specialists.\\n• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof controls relating to data transmission through the different \\nIT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\nInformation Other than the Financial \\nStatements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\n• The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nother information. The other information comprises the \\ninformation included in the Annual Report, but does \\nnot include the Consolidated Financial Statements, \\nStandalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s \\nreport thereon.\\n• Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \\ndoes not cover the other information and we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n• In connection with our audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements, our responsibility is to read \\nthe other information, compare with the financial \\nstatements / financial information of the joint operations, \\nsubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates audited by the \\nother auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities \\nand, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other \\nauditors and consider whether the other information is \\nmaterially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements or our knowledge obtained during the \\ncourse of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially \\nmisstated. Other information so far as it relates to \\nthe joint operations, subsidiaries, joint ventures and \\nassociates, is traced from their financial statements / \\nfinancial information audited by the other auditors. \\n  If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \\nthat there is a material misstatement of this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We have \\nnothing to report in this regard.Management’s Responsibility for the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\nThe Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \\nthe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial \\nposition, consolidated financial performance including \\nother comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and \\nconsolidated changes in equity of the Group including its \\nassociates and joint ventures in accordance with the Ind \\nAS and other accounting principles generally accepted in \\nIndia. The respective Board of Directors of the companies \\nincluded in the Group and of its associates and joint \\nventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate \\naccounting records in accordance with the provisions of \\nthe Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its \\nassociates and its joint ventures and for preventing and \\ndetecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and \\napplication of appropriate accounting policies; making \\njudgments and estimates that are reasonable and \\nprudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of \\nadequate internal financial controls, that were operating \\neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness \\nof the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and \\npresentation of the financial statements that give a true \\nand fair view and are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error, which have been used for \\nthe purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the \\nrespective Board of Directors of the companies included \\nin the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are \\nresponsible for assessing the ability of the respective \\nCorporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\n404 405\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23CONSOLIDATED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\\nentities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as \\napplicable, matters related to going concern and using the \\ngoing concern basis of accounting unless the respective \\nBoard of Directors either intends to liquidate their \\nrespective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic \\nalternative but to do so.\\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies \\nincluded in the Group and of its associates and joint \\nventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial \\nreporting process of the Group and of its associates and \\njoint ventures.\\nAuditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of \\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted \\nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually \\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the \\nbasis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \\noverride of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control \\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section \\n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing \\nour opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal \\nfinancial controls system in place and the operating \\neffectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \\nrelated disclosures made by the management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that \\nmay cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group \\nand its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty \\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s \\nreport to the related disclosures in the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements or, if such disclosures are \\ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of \\nour auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions \\nmay cause the Group and its associates and joint \\nventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding \\nthe financial information of the entities or business \\nactivities within the Group and its associates and joint \\nventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements. We are responsible for the \\ndirection, supervision and performance of the audit of \\nthe financial statements of such entities or business \\nactivities included in the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of which we are the independent auditors. \\nFor the other entities or business activities included \\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have \\nbeen audited by the other auditors, such other auditors \\nremain responsible for the direction, supervision and \\nperformance of the audits carried out by them. We \\nremain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\\n Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in \\naggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions \\nof a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements may be influenced. We consider \\nquantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in \\nplanning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating \\nthe results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect \\nof any identified misstatements in the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \\nof the Parent and such other entities included in the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements of which we are the \\nindependent auditors regarding, among other matters, the \\nplanned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit \\nfindings, including any significant deficiencies in internal \\ncontrol that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with \\na statement that we have complied with relevant \\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to \\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \\nwe determine that a matter should not be communicated \\nin our report because the adverse consequences of doing \\nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \\ninterest benefits of such communication.\\nOther Matters\\n(a)  The Consolidated Financial Statements include \\nthe financial statements / financial information of \\n181 subsidiaries, whose Standalone / Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements / financial information reflect \\ntotal assets of C 8,02,378 crore as at 31st March, 2023, \\ntotal revenues of C 2,45,656 crore and net cash inflows \\namounting to C 767 crore for the year ended on that \\ndate.

Corporate Information\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise \\nfinancial statements of “Reliance Industries Limited” \\n(“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively \\nreferred to as “the Group”) for the year ended 31st \\nMarch, 2023.\\n  The Company is a listed entity incorporated in India. \\nThe registered office of the Company is located at \\n3rd Floor, Maker Chambers IV, 222, Nariman Point, \\nMumbai - 400 021, India.\\n  The principal activities of the Group, its joint ventures \\nand associates consist of Oil to Chemicals (O2C), Oil \\nand Gas, Retail and Digital Services. Further details \\nabout the business operations of the Group are \\nprovided in Note 39 – Segment Information.\\nB. Significant Accounting Policies\\nB.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been \\nprepared on the historical cost basis except for the \\nfollowing assets and liabilities which have been \\nmeasured at fair value:\\n i.  Certain financial assets and liabilities (including \\nderivative instruments),\\n ii. Defined Benefit Plan’s – Plan Assets and\\n iii. Equity settled Share Based Payments\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements of the \\nGroup have been prepared in accordance with \\nIndian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under \\nthe Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \\nRules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and \\npresentation requirements of Division II of Schedule \\nIII to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant \\nSchedule III), as applicable to the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements comprises \\nof Reliance Industries Limited and all its subsidiaries, \\nbeing the entities that it controls. Control is assessed \\nin accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 – \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented \\nin Indian Rupees ( C) and all values are rounded \\nto the nearest crore ( C 00,00,000), except when \\notherwise indicated.\\nB.2 Principles of Consolidation\\n (a)  The financial statements of the Company and its \\nsubsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis \\nby adding together like items of assets, liabilities, \\nequity, incomes, expenses and cash flows, after \\nfully eliminating intra-group balances and intra-\\ngroup transactions. (b)  Profits or losses resulting from intra-group  \\ntransactions that are recognised in assets, such \\nas Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, \\nare eliminated in full.\\n (c)  In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are \\nconsolidated at the average rate prevailing during \\nthe year. All assets and liabilities are converted \\nat rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any \\nexchange difference arising on consolidation is \\nrecognised in the Foreign Currency Translation \\nReserve (FCTR).\\n (d)  The audited/unaudited financial statements of \\nforeign subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates \\nhave been prepared in accordance with the \\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principle of its \\nCountry of Incorporation or Ind AS.\\n (e)  The differences in accounting policies of the \\nCompany and its subsidiaries/joint ventures/ \\nassociates are not material and there are no \\nmaterial transactions from 1st January, 2023 to \\n31st March, 2023 in respect of subsidiaries/joint \\nventures/associates having financial year ended \\n31st\\xa0December, 2022.\\n (f)  The Consolidated Financial Statements have \\nbeen prepared using uniform accounting \\npolicies for like transactions and other events in \\nsimilar circumstances.\\n (g)  The carrying amount of the parent’s investment \\nin each subsidiary is offset (eliminated) against \\nthe parent’s portion of equity in each subsidiary.\\n (h)  The difference between the proceeds from \\ndisposal of investment in subsidiaries and the \\ncarrying amount of its assets less liabilities as \\non the date of disposal is recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being \\nthe profit or loss on disposal of investment \\nin subsidiary.\\n (i)  Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has \\nbeen accounted under the Equity Method as per \\nInd AS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint \\nVentures. Investments in joint operations are \\naccounted using the Proportionate Consolidation \\nMethod as per Ind AS 111 – Joint Arrangements.\\n (j)  The Group accounts for its share of post-\\nacquisition changes in net assets of associates \\nand joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised \\nprofits and losses resulting from transactions \\nbetween the Group and its associates and \\njoint ventures.\\n (k)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of profit/loss of \\nconsolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified \\nand adjusted against the income of the Group in \\norder to arrive at the net income attributable to \\nshareholders of the Company. (l)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of net assets \\nof consolidated subsidiaries is identified and \\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\nB.3  Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies\\n (a) Current and Non-Current Classification\\n   The Group presents assets and liabilities in \\nthe Balance Sheet based on Current/Non-\\nCurrent classification.\\n  An asset is treated as Current when it is –\\n  -  Expected to be realised or intended to be \\nsold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\\n  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  Expected to be realised within twelve \\nmonths after the reporting period, or\\n  -  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted \\nfrom being exchanged or used to settle a \\nliability for at least twelve months after the \\nreporting period.\\n  All other assets are classified as Non-Current.\\n  A liability is treated as Current when –\\n  -  It is expected to be settled in normal \\noperating cycle;\\n  -  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\\n  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n  -  There is no unconditional right to defer the \\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve \\nmonths after the reporting period.\\n   The Group classifies all other liabilities as \\nNon-Current.\\n   Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified \\nas Non-Current Assets and Liabilities.\\n (b) Business Combination\\n   Business Combinations are accounted for using \\nthe acquisition method of accounting, except \\nfor common control transactions which are \\naccounted using the pooling of interest method \\nthat is accounted at carrying values.\\n   The cost of an acquisition is measured at the \\nfair value of the assets transferred, equity \\ninstruments issued and liabilities assumed at \\ntheir acquisition date i.e. the date on which \\ncontrol is acquired. Contingent consideration \\nto be transferred is recognised at fair value \\nand included as part of cost of acquisition. \\nTransaction related costs are expensed in the \\nperiod in which the costs are incurred.   For each business combination, the Group \\nelects whether to measure the non-controlling \\ninterests in the acquiree at fair value or at the \\nproportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable \\nnet assets.\\n   Goodwill arising on business combination is \\ninitially measured at cost, being the excess of \\nthe aggregate of the consideration transferred \\nand the amount recognised for non-controlling \\ninterests, and any previous interest held, over \\nthe fair value of net identifiable assets acquired \\nand liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually \\nand measured at cost less any accumulated \\nimpairment losses if any.\\n   Common control business combination: Business \\ncombinations involving entities or businesses that \\nare controlled by the group are accounted using \\nthe pooling of interest method.\\n (c) Property, Plant and Equipment\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at \\ncost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount \\nand rebates less accumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing cost and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets \\nto its working condition for its intended use, \\nnet charges on foreign exchange contracts \\nand adjustments arising from exchange rate \\nvariations attributable to the assets. In case of \\nland the Group has availed fair value as deemed \\ncost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment \\nwhich are significant to the total cost of that item \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment and having \\ndifferent useful life are accounted separately. \\nOther Indirect Expenses incurred relating to \\nproject, net of income earned during the project \\ndevelopment stage prior to its intended use, \\nare considered as pre-operative expenses and \\ndisclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\\n   Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment \\nis provided using written down value method \\non depreciable amount except in case of certain \\nassets of Oil to Chemicals and other segment \\nwhich are depreciated using straight line method. \\nDepreciation on wireless telecommunications \\nequipment and components is determined based \\non the expected pattern of consumption of the \\nexpected future economic benefits.

Gains or \\nlosses arising from derecognition of a Property, \\nPlant and Equipment are measured as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds \\nand the carrying amount of the asset and are \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n (d) Leases\\n   The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of-\\nuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing \\narrangements, if the contract conveys the right to \\ncontrol the use of an identified asset.\\n   The contract conveys the right to control the \\nuse of an identified asset, if it involves the \\nuse of an identified asset and the Group has \\nsubstantially all of the economic benefits from \\nuse of the asset and has right to direct the use \\nof the identified asset. The cost of the right-\\nof-use asset shall comprise of the amount of \\nthe initial measurement of the lease liability \\nadjusted for any lease payments made at or \\nbefore the commencement date plus any \\ninitial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use \\nassets is subsequently measured at cost less \\nany accumulated depreciation/amortisation, \\naccumulated impairment losses, if any and \\nadjusted for any remeasurement of the lease \\nliability. The right -of-use asset is depreciated/\\namortised using the straight-line method from \\nthe commencement date over the shorter of \\nlease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\\n   The Group measures the lease liability at the \\npresent value of the lease payments that are not \\npaid at the commencement date of the lease. \\nThe lease payments are discounted using the \\ninterest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can \\nbe readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental \\nborrowing rate.\\n   For short-term and low value leases, the Group \\nrecognises the lease payments as an operating \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the \\nlease term.\\n   The Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as \\nan operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are \\nclassified as finance lease whenever the terms \\nof the lease transfer substantially all the risks \\nand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other \\nleases are classified as operating leases.\\n (e) Other Intangible Assets\\n   Other Intangible Assets are stated at cost of \\nacquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade \\ndiscount and rebates less accumulated \\namortisation/depletion and impairment loss, if \\nany. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing \\ncosts, and any cost directly attributable for \\npreparing the asset for its intended use, net \\ncharges on foreign exchange contracts and \\nadjustments arising from exchange rate \\nvariations attributable to the Other Intangible \\nAssets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, \\nthe Group has availed fair value as deemed cost \\non the date of transition to Ind AS.\\n   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate \\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the \\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating \\nto project, net of income earned during \\nthe project development stage prior to its \\nintended use, are considered as pre-operative \\nexpenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nUnder Development.\\n   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of \\nan Other Intangible Asset are measured as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds \\nand the carrying amount of the asset and are \\nrecognised in the Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n   The Group’s Other Intangible Assets include \\nassets with finite and indefinite useful life. \\nAssets with finite useful life are amortised on a \\nstraight-line basis over their expected useful life \\nand assets with indefinite useful lives are not \\namortised but are tested for impairment annually \\nat the cash generating unit level.\\n   A summary of the amortisation/depletion policies \\napplied to the Group’s Other Intangible Assets to \\nthe extent of depreciable amount is as follows.Particulars Depreciation\\nT echnical \\nKnow-HowOver the useful life of the underlying \\nassets ranging from 5 years to 35 years\\nComputer \\nSoftwareOver a period of 5 to 10 years.\\nDevelopment \\nRightsW.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the \\nunit of production method. The cost of \\nproducing wells along with its related \\nfacilities including decommissioning \\ncosts are depleted in proportion of oil \\nand gas production achieved vis-à-vis \\nProved Developed Reserves. The cost \\nfor common facilities including its \\ndecommissioning costs are depleted \\nusing Proved Reserves. W.r.t. other \\ndevelopment rights, amortised over the \\nperiod of contract.\\nLicense Fee Amortised over the remainder of \\nthe License period from the date of \\ncommencement of the commercial \\noperation.\\nSpectrum  \\nFeesAmortised from the date of \\ncommencement of commercial \\noperation over the balance validity \\nperiod, based on the expected pattern \\nof consumption of the expected future \\neconomic benefits, in accordance with \\nthe applicable Accounting Standards.\\nOthers In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount \\namortised to date is not less than the \\naggregate rebate availed by the Group.\\n   The amortisation period and the amortisation \\nmethod for Other Intangible Assets with a finite \\nuseful life are reviewed at each reporting date.\\n (f) Research and Development Expenditure\\n   Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is \\ncharged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss as and when incurred. Development \\ncosts are capitalised as an intangible asset if it \\ncan be demonstrated that the project is expected \\nto generate future economic benefits, it is \\nprobable that those future economic benefits \\nwill flow to the entity and the costs of the asset \\ncan be measured reliably, else it is charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n (g) Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n   Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash \\non hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and \\nshort-term highly liquid investments that are \\nreadily convertible to known amounts of cash \\nand which are subject to an insignificant risk of \\nchanges in value.\\n (h) Finance Costs\\n   Borrowing costs include exchange differences \\narising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the \\ninterest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction \\nof qualifying assets are capitalised as part of \\nthe cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is \\none that necessarily takes substantial period of \\ntime to get ready for its intended use. Interest \\nincome earned on the temporary investment of \\nspecific borrowings pending their expenditure on \\nqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing \\ncosts eligible for capitalisation.\\n   All other borrowing costs are charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for \\nthe period for which they are incurred.\\n (i) Inventories\\n   Items of inventories are measured at lower of \\ncost and net realisable value after providing \\nfor obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-\\nproducts which are valued at net realisable value. \\nCost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, \\ncost of conversion and other costs including \\nmanufacturing overheads net of recoverable \\ntaxes incurred in bringing them to their \\nrespective present location and condition. Cost of \\nfinished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, \\nchemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, \\ntrading and other products are determined on \\nweighted average basis.\\n (j)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets — \\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill \\nand Other Intangible Assets\\n   The Group assesses at each reporting date as to \\nwhether there is any indication that any Property, \\nPlant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other \\nIntangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash \\nGenerating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any \\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount \\nof an asset or CGU is estimated to determine \\nthe extent of impairment, if any. When it is not \\npossible to estimate the recoverable amount \\nof an individual asset, the Group estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of the CGU to which the \\nasset belongs.\\n   An impairment loss is recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to \\nthe extent, asset’s carrying amount exceeds its \\nrecoverable amount. The recoverable amount \\nis higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of \\ndisposal and value in use. Value in use is based \\non the estimated future cash flows, discounted \\nto their present value using pre-tax discount \\nrate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and risk specific to the \\nassets. The impairment loss recognised in prior Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n422 423\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23accounting period is reversed if there has been a \\nchange in the estimate of recoverable amount.\\n (k) Provisions\\n   Provisions are recognised when the Group has \\na present obligation (legal or constructive) as \\na result of a past event, it is probable that an \\noutflow of resources embodying economic \\nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation \\nand a reliable estimate can be made of the \\namount of the obligation. If the effect of the \\ntime value of money is material, provisions are \\ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \\nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \\nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \\ntime is recognised as a finance cost.\\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Group records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount \\non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding \\nof discount is recognised in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n (l) Contingent Liability\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one \\nor more uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of the Group or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying \\neconomic benefits will be required to settle or a \\nreliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\\n (m) Employee Benefits Expense\\n  Short-Term Employee Benefits\\n   The undiscounted amount of short-term \\nemployee benefits expected to be paid in \\nexchange for the services rendered by employees \\nare recognised as an expense during the period \\nwhen the employees render the services.  Post-Employment Benefits\\n  Defined Contribution Plans\\n   The Group recognises contribution payable \\nto the provident fund scheme as an expense, \\nwhen an employee renders the related service. \\nIf the contribution payable to the scheme for \\nservice received before the balance sheet date \\nexceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit \\npayable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. \\nIf the contribution already paid exceeds the \\ncontribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date, then excess is recognised \\nas an asset to the extent that the pre-payment \\nwill lead to, for example, a reduction in future \\npayment or refund.\\n  Defined Benefit Plans\\n   The Group pays gratuity to the employees \\nwho have completed five years of service at \\nthe time of resignation/superannuation. The \\ngratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every \\ncompleted year of service as per the Payment of \\nGratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount \\nis contributed to the approved gratuity fund \\nformed exclusively for gratuity payment to the \\nemployees. The gratuity fund has been approved \\nby respective Income Tax authorities. The liability \\nin respect of gratuity and other post-employment \\nbenefits is calculated using the Projected Unit \\nCredit Method and spread over the period during \\nwhich the benefit is expected to be derived from \\nemployees’ services.\\n   Remeasurement gains and losses arising \\nfrom adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in \\nthe period in which they occur, in Other \\nComprehensive Income.\\n  Employee Separation Costs\\n   The Group recognises the employee separation \\ncost when the scheme is announced and the \\nGroup is demonstrably committed to it.\\n (n) Tax Expenses\\n   The tax expenses for the period comprises of \\nCurrent Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is \\nrecognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, except to the extent that it relates to \\nitems recognised in the Other Comprehensive \\nIncome. In which case, the tax is also recognised \\nin Other Comprehensive Income.\\n  i. Current Tax\\n    Current tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the amount expected to be \\nrecovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that \\nare enacted at the Balance sheet date.\\n  ii. Deferred Tax\\n    Deferred Tax is recognised on temporary \\ndifferences between the carrying amounts \\nof assets and liabilities in the financial \\nstatements and the corresponding tax \\nbases used in the computation of taxable \\nprofit. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised \\nto the extent it is probable that taxable \\nprofit will be available against which the \\ndeductible temporary differences, and the \\ncarry forward of unused tax losses can be \\nutilised. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets \\nare measured at the tax rates that are \\nexpected to apply in the period in which \\nthe liability is settled or the asset realised, \\nbased on tax rates (and tax laws) that have \\nbeen enacted or substantively enacted \\nby the end of the reporting period. The \\ncarrying amount of deferred tax liabilities \\nand assets are reviewed at the end of each \\nreporting period.\\n (o) Share Based Payments\\n   Equity-settled share based payments to \\nemployees and others providing similar services \\nare measured at the fair value of the equity \\ninstruments at the grant date. Details regarding \\nthe determination of the fair value of equity-\\nsettled share based payments transactions are \\nset out in Note 28.2. The fair value determined \\nat the grant date of the equity-settled share \\nbased payments is expensed on a straight line \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the \\nGroup’s estimate of equity instruments that will \\neventually vest, with a corresponding increase \\nin equity. At the end of each reporting period, \\nthe Group revises its estimate of the number \\nof equity instruments expected to vest. The \\nimpact of the revision of the original estimates, \\nif any, is recognised in Consolidated Statement \\nof Profit and Loss such that the cumulative \\nexpenses reflects the revised estimate, with a \\ncorresponding adjustment to the Share Based \\nPayments Reserve. The dilutive effect of \\noutstanding options is reflected as additional \\nshare dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\n (p)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded \\nat the exchange rate prevailing on the date \\nof transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency’s closing rates of \\nexchange at the reporting date.\\n   Exchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except \\nto the extent of exchange differences which are \\nregarded as an adjustment to interest costs on \\nforeign currency borrowings that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction \\nof qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of \\nassets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on \\nforeign currency borrowings taken prior to April \\n1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or \\nconstruction of qualifying assets are adjusted in \\nthe carrying cost of such assets.\\n   Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are \\nrecorded using the exchange rates at the date of \\nthe transaction. Non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value in a foreign currency are translated \\nusing the exchange rates at the date when the \\nfair value was measured. The gain or loss arising \\non translation of non-monetary items measured \\nat fair value is treated in line with the recognition \\nof the gain or loss on the change in fair value \\nof the item (i.e. translation differences on items \\nwhose fair value gain or loss is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income or Statement \\nof Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other \\nComprehensive Income or Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, respectively).\\n   In case of an asset, expense or income where a \\nnon-monetary advance is paid/received, the date \\nof transaction is the date on which the advance \\nwas initially recognised. If there were multiple \\npayments or receipts in advance, multiple dates \\nof transactions are determined for each payment \\nor receipt of advance consideration.\\n (q) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is \\nrecognised when control of the goods or \\nservices are transferred to the customer at an \\namount that reflects the consideration entitled in \\nexchange for those goods or services. The Group \\nis generally the principal as it typically controls \\nthe goods or services before transferring them to \\nthe customer.\\n   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment \\nof goods to the customer or when the goods \\nis made available to the customer, provided \\ntransfer of title to the customer occurs and the \\nGroup has not retained any significant risks of \\nownership or future obligations with respect to \\nthe goods shipped.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n424 425\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23   Revenue from rendering of services is recognised \\nover time by measuring the progress towards \\ncomplete satisfaction of performance obligations \\nat the reporting period.\\n   Revenue is measured at the amount of \\nconsideration which the group expects to be \\nentitled to in exchange for transferring distinct \\ngoods or services to a customer as specified in \\nthe contract, excluding amounts collected on \\nbehalf of third parties (for example taxes and \\nduties collected on behalf of the government).\\n   Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction \\nof performance obligations and a receivable \\nis recognised when it becomes unconditional. \\nGenerally, the credit period varies between 0-60 \\ndays from the shipment or delivery of goods or \\nservices as the case may be.\\n   The Group provides volume rebates to certain \\ncustomers once the quantity of products \\npurchased during the period exceeds a threshold \\nspecified and also accrues discounts to certain \\ncustomers based on customary business \\npractices which is derived on the basis of crude \\nprice volatility and various market demand – \\nsupply situations. Consideration is determined \\nbased on its most likely amount.\\n   Generally, sales of petroleum products contain \\nprovisional pricing features where revenue is \\ninitially recognised based on provisional price. \\nDifference between final settlement price and \\nprovisional price is recognised subsequently.\\n   The Group does not adjust short-term advances \\nreceived from the customer for the effects of \\nsignificant financing component if it is expected \\nat the contract inception that the promised good \\nor service will be transferred to the customer \\nwithin a period of one year.\\n  Contract Balances\\n  Trade Receivables\\n   A receivable represents the Group’s right to an \\namount of consideration that is unconditional.\\n  Contract Liabilities\\n   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer \\ngoods or services to a customer for which the \\nGroup has received consideration or is due from \\nthe customer. If a customer pays consideration \\nbefore the Group transfers goods or services to \\nthe customer, a contract liability is recognised \\nwhen the payment is made or the payment is \\ndue (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are \\nrecognised as revenue when the Group performs \\nunder the contract.  Interest Income\\n   Interest Income from a financial asset is \\nrecognised using Effective Interest Rate Method.\\n  Dividend Income\\n   Dividend Income is recognised when the Group’s \\nright to receive the amount has been established.\\n (r) Financial Instruments\\n  i.  Financial Assets\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All financial assets are initially recognised at \\nfair value. Transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nfinancial assets, which are not at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the \\nfair value on initial recognition. Purchase \\nand sale of financial assets are recognised \\nusing trade date accounting. However, trade \\nreceivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at \\ntransaction price.  \\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n  a)  Financial assets measured at Amortised \\nCost (AC)\\n    A financial asset is measured at Amortised \\nCost if it is held within a business model \\nwhose objective is to hold the asset in \\norder to collect contractual cash flows \\nand the contractual terms of the financial \\nasset give rise to cash flows on specified \\ndates that represent solely payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n  b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Other Comprehensive Income \\n(FVTOCI)\\n    A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI \\nif it is held within a business model whose \\nobjective is achieved by both collecting \\ncontractual cash flows and selling financial \\nassets and the contractual terms of the \\nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to \\ncash flows that represent solely payments \\nof principal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding.\\n  c)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\\n    A financial asset which is not classified in \\nany of the above categories are measured \\nat FVTPL.\\n    Financial assets are reclassified subsequent \\nto their recognition, if the Group changes its business model for managing those \\nfinancial assets. Changes in business model \\nare made and applied prospectively from \\nthe reclassification date following the \\nchanges in business model in accordance \\nwith principles laid down under Ind AS 109 \\n– Financial Instruments.\\n  C. Other Equity Investments\\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Consolidated Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, except for those equity investments \\nfor which the Group has elected to present \\nthe value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \\nIncome’.\\n    However, dividend on such equity \\ninvestments is recognised in Statement of \\nProfit and Loss when the Company’s right \\nto receive payment is established.\\n  D. Impairment of Financial Assets\\n    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group \\nuses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for \\nevaluating impairment of financial assets \\nother than those measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected \\nCredit Losses are measured through a loss \\nallowance at an amount equal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or\\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from all \\npossible default events over the life of the \\nfinancial instrument).\\n    For trade receivables, the Group applies \\n‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \\nThe Group uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Group uses 12 month \\nExpected Credit Loss to provide for \\nimpairment loss where there is no significant \\nincrease in credit risk. If there is significant \\nincrease in credit risk full lifetime Expected \\nCredit Loss is used.  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n    All financial liabilities are recognised at fair \\nvalue and in case of borrowings, net of \\ndirectly attributable cost. Fees of recurring \\nnature are directly recognised in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \\nas finance cost.\\n  B.  Subsequent Measurement\\n    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised \\ncost using the effective interest method. For \\ntrade and other payables maturing within \\none year from the balance sheet date, the \\ncarrying amounts approximate fair value due \\nto the short maturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Group uses various derivative financial \\ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, \\ncurrency swaps, forwards and options and \\ncommodity contracts to mitigate the risk \\nof changes in interest rates, exchange rates \\nand commodity prices. At the inception of \\na hedge relationship, the Group formally \\ndesignates and documents the hedge \\nrelationship to which the Group wishes \\nto apply hedge accounting and the risk \\nmanagement objective and strategy for \\nundertaking the hedge. Such derivative \\nfinancial instruments are initially recognised \\nat fair value on the date on which a \\nderivative contract is entered into and \\nare also subsequently measured at fair \\nvalue. Derivatives are carried as financial \\nassets when the fair value is positive and \\nas financial liabilities when the fair value \\nis negative.\\n    Any gains or losses arising from changes \\nin the fair value of derivatives are taken \\ndirectly to Consolidated Statement of Profit \\nand Loss, except for the effective portion \\nof cash flow hedge which is recognised in \\nOther Comprehensive Income and later to \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, \\nwhen the hedged item affects profit or loss \\nor is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged \\nforecast transaction subsequently results in \\nthe recognition of a non-financial asset or \\nnon-financial liability.\\n    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows:\\n  A. Cash Flow Hedge\\n    The Group designates derivative contracts \\nor non-derivative financial assets/liabilities Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n426 427\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23as hedging instruments to mitigate the \\nrisk of movement in interest rates and \\nforeign exchange rates for foreign exchange \\nexposure on highly probable future cash \\nflows attributable to a recognised asset or \\nliability or forecast cash transactions. When \\na derivative is designated as a cash flow \\nhedging instrument, the effective portion \\nof changes in the fair value of the derivative \\nis recognised in the cash flow hedging \\nreserve being part of Other Comprehensive \\nIncome. Any ineffective portion of changes \\nin the fair value of the derivative is \\nrecognised immediately in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging \\nrelationship no longer meets the criteria for \\nhedge accounting, then hedge accounting \\nis discontinued prospectively. If the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold/terminated \\nor exercised, the cumulative gain or loss \\non the hedging instrument recognised in \\ncash flow hedging reserve till the period \\nthe hedge was effective remains in cash \\nflow hedging reserve until the underlying \\ntransaction occurs. The cumulative gain \\nor loss previously recognised in the cash \\nflow hedging reserve is transferred to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \\nupon the occurrence of the underlying \\ntransaction. If the forecasted transaction \\nis no longer expected to occur, then the \\namount accumulated in cash flow hedging \\nreserve is reclassified in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n  B. Fair Value Hedge\\n    The Group designates derivative contracts \\nor non-derivative financial assets/liabilities \\nas hedging instruments to mitigate the \\nrisk of change in fair value of hedged item \\ndue to movement in interest rates, foreign \\nexchange rates and commodity prices.\\n    Changes in the fair value of hedging \\ninstruments and hedged items that \\nare designated and qualify as fair value \\nhedges are recorded in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging \\nrelationship no longer meets the criteria \\nfor hedge accounting, the adjustment to \\nthe carrying amount of a hedged item for \\nwhich the effective interest method is used \\nis amortised to Consolidated Statement of \\nProfit and Loss over the period of maturity.\\n  iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\\n    The Group derecognises a financial asset \\nwhen the contractual rights to the cash \\nflows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer \\nqualifies for derecognition under Ind AS \\n109 – Financial Instruments. A financial \\nliability (or a part of a financial liability) is \\nderecognised from the Group’s Balance \\nSheet when the obligation specified in \\nthe contract is discharged or cancelled \\nor expires.\\n  v.  Offsetting\\n    Financial assets and financial liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe Balance Sheet when, and only when, \\nthe Group has a legally enforceable right to \\nset off the amount and it intends, either to \\nsettle them on a net basis or to realise the \\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\n (s) Non-Current Assets Held for Sale\\n   Non-Current Assets are classified as Held for \\nSale if their carrying amount will be recovered \\nprincipally through a sale transaction rather than \\nthrough continuing use and sale is considered \\nhighly probable. A sale is considered as highly \\nprobable when decision has been made to \\nsell, assets are available for immediate sale in \\nits present condition, assets are being actively \\nmarketed and sale has been agreed or is \\nexpected to be concluded within 12 months of \\nthe date of classification. Non-current assets held \\nfor sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. \\nAssets and liabilities classified as Held for Sale \\nare measured at the lower of their carrying \\namount and fair value less cost of disposal and \\nare presented separately in the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheet.\\n (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   The Group has adopted Successful Efforts \\nMethod (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas \\nactivities. The policy of recognition of exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure is considered in \\nline with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, \\ngeological and geophysical studies, petroleum \\nexploration license fees and general and \\nadministration costs directly attributable to \\nexploration and evaluation activities are expensed \\noff. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest \\nin oil and gas blocks and on exploration and \\nevaluation other than those which are expensed \\noff are accounted for as Intangible Assets under \\nDevelopment. All development costs incurred in \\nrespect of Proved Reserves are also capitalised \\nunder Intangible Assets under Development. \\nOnce a well is ready to commence commercial \\nproduction, the costs accumulated in Intangible \\nAssets under Development are classified as \\nOther Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration \\nand evaluation expenditure which does not result \\nin discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all \\ncost pertaining to production are charged to the \\nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n   The Group uses technical estimation of reserves \\nas per the Petroleum Resources Management \\nSystem guidelines 2011 and standard geological \\nand reservoir engineering methods. The reserve \\nreview and evaluation is carried out annually. Oil \\nand Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of Joint \\nOperations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as \\nwell as income and expenditure are accounted \\non the basis of available information on a line-\\nby-line basis with similar items in the financial \\nstatements, according to the participating interest \\nof the Group.\\n (u) Earnings Per Share\\n   Basic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing \\nthe net profit after tax by the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares outstanding during the \\nyear adjusted for bonus element in equity share. \\nDiluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures \\nused in determination of basic earnings per share \\nto take into account the conversion of all dilutive \\npotential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity \\nshares are deemed converted as at the beginning \\nof the period unless issued at a later date.\\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements and \\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Group’s financial statements \\nrequires management to make judgement, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \\nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about \\nthese assumptions and estimates could result in \\noutcomes that require a material adjustment to the \\ncarrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in \\nfuture periods.\\n(A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Group’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Group’s estimates of its oil \\nand natural gas reserves. The Group bases it’s proved \\nreserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable \\ncertainty with rigorous technical and commercial \\nassessments based on conventional industry practice \\nand regulatory requirements.  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used \\nto calculate depletion charges for the Group’s \\noil and gas properties. The impact of changes in \\nestimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively \\nby amortising the remaining carrying value of the \\nasset over the expected future production. Oil and \\nnatural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the \\nassessment of the recoverability of asset carrying \\nvalues reported in the financial statements. Details on \\nproved reserves and production both on product and \\ngeographical basis are provided in Note 35.\\n(B) Decommissioning Liabilities\\n  The liability for decommissioning costs are recognised \\nwhen the Group has an obligation to perform site \\nrestoration activity. The recognition and measurement \\nof decommissioning provisions involves the use of \\nestimates and assumptions. These include the timing \\nof abandonment of well and related facilities which \\nwould depend upon the ultimate life of the field, \\nexpected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope \\nof abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied \\nfor discounting.\\n(C)  Property Plant and Equipment/Other \\nIntangible Assets\\n  Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating in \\nthe manner intended by the management. Property, \\nPlant and Equipment/Other Intangible Assets are \\ndepreciated/ amortised over their estimated useful \\nlife, after taking into account estimated residual value. \\nSpectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity \\nperiod, based on the expected pattern of consumption \\nof the expected future economic benefits.\\n  Management reviews the estimated useful life and \\nresidual values of the assets annually in order to \\ndetermine the amount of depreciation/amortisation \\nto be recorded during any reporting period. The useful \\nlife and residual values are based on the Group’s \\nhistorical experience with similar assets and take into \\naccount anticipated technological and future risks. \\nThe depreciation/ amortisation for future periods \\nis revised if there are significant changes from \\nprevious estimates.\\n(D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\\n  Judgements are required in assessing the \\nrecoverability of overdue trade receivables and \\ndetermining whether a provision against those \\nreceivables is required. Factors considered include \\nthe credit rating of the counterparty, the amount \\nand timing of anticipated future payments and any \\npossible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk \\nof non-payment.Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n428 429\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23(E) Provisions\\n  The timing of recognition and quantification of \\nthe liability requires the application of judgement \\nto existing facts and circumstances, which can be \\nsubject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions \\nand liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to \\ntake account of changing facts and circumstances.\\n(F)  Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible \\nAssets with indefinite useful life\\n  Management reviews the carrying value of goodwill \\nand intangible assets with indefinite useful life \\nannually, to determine whether there has been any \\nimpairment by allocating the value of goodwill and \\nintangible assets with indefinite useful life to a Cash \\nGenerating Unit (CGU). The Group has identified  \\nCGUs’ for this purpose, considering the nature of the \\nbusinesses to which each of the CGU relates. \\n  Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU is \\naggregate of cash flow projections, for five years as \\napproved by Senior Management and beyond five \\nyears extrapolated using a long-term growth rate \\nwhich ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash flow projections \\nare discounted by a pre-tax discount rate, being the \\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which \\nranges from 8% to 12%.\\n  The Management believes that any reasonably \\npossible change in the above key assumptions \\non which recoverable amount is based would not \\ncause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the \\naggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.\\n(G)  Impairment of Financial and \\nNon-Financial Assets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are \\nbased on assumptions about risk of default and \\nexpected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement \\nin making these assumptions and selecting the inputs \\nto the impairment calculation, based on Group’s past \\nhistory, existing market conditions as well as forward-\\nlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets, the Group estimates \\nasset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an \\nasset’s or Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less \\ncosts of disposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using \\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \\nspecific to the asset. In determining fair value less \\ncosts of disposal, recent market transactions are taken \\ninto account, if no such transactions can be identified, \\nan appropriate valuation model is used.  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives \\nhave been allocated to the respective CGUs which are \\ndetermined at the entity level. During the year ended \\nMarch 31, 2023, the Group has determined that there \\nis no impairment towards these assets.\\n(H)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and \\nLiabilities\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses for \\nwhich there is probability of utilisation against the \\nfuture taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to \\ndetermine the amount of deferred tax that can be \\nrecognised, based upon the likely timing and the level \\nof future taxable profits and business developments.\\n(I) Fair Value Measurement\\n  For estimates relating to fair value of financial \\ninstruments refer Note 38 of financial statements.\\n(J) Revenue\\n  The application of Accounting Standard on \\nRevenue Recognition for digital segment involves \\ncomplexity and use of key judgements with respect \\nto multiple elements deliverables, timing of revenue \\nrecognition, accounting of discounts, incentives, etc. \\nThe\\xa0Management has reviewed such accounting \\ntreatment and is satisfied about its appropriateness in \\nterms of the relevant Ind AS.\\n(K) Leases\\n  The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to \\nbe a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. \\nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement. \\nThe Group uses judgement in assessing whether a \\ncontract (or part of contract) include a lease, the lease \\nterm (including anticipated renewals), the applicable \\ndiscount rate, variable lease payments whether \\nare in-substance fixed. The judgement involves \\nassessment of whether the asset included in the \\ncontract is a fully or partly identified asset based on \\nthe facts and circumstances, whether the contract \\ninclude a lease and non-lease component and if so, \\nseparation thereof for the purpose of recognition and \\nmeasurement, determination of lease term basis, inter \\nalia the non-cancellable period of lease and whether \\nthe lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use \\nof the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the \\nlease payments are fixed are variable or a combination \\nof both.D. Standards Issued but not Effective\\n  On March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs \\n(MCA) has notified Companies (Indian Accounting \\nStandards) Amendment Rules, 2023.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the \\nterms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined \\nin the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI \\nof $\\xa0165 million ( C 1,353 crore) being the Company`s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,029 crore) towards additional \\nProfit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023. \\nThe next date of hearing is awaited.\\n   In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified \\nthe New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014.

The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool \\nAccount is C 295 crore (net) as at 31st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in \\nrespect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been \\nchallenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 35.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US$ \\n1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks.

Tribunal gave favorable \\naward on 29th January, 2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case Award”). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements \\nCase Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application \\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral \\nTribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which \\nwill take place post determination of Claimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs. \\n    GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the \\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and \\nexecution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The \\nClaimants contend that GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government’s Execution Petition \\nbefore the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon\\'ble Court ruled that Government of India’s execution petition seeking \\nenforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal’s Final Partial Award dated 12th October, 2016 (“2016 FPA”) \\nrelating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.\\n  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a \\nperiod of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses \\nin the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\\n   Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible \\nexposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/litigations. \\nMoreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\\n(C in crore)\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023As at  \\n31st March, 2022\\n36.

Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) of SEBI in respect of the \\nSCN. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity \\nderivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the \\ndate of the order; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from \\nNovember 29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities \\nAppellate Tribunal (“SAT”) against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 \\nand directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other \\nnoticees has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble \\nSupreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of \\nthe appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order \\ndated December 17, 2020 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. In the very same matter, on November 21, 2017, SEBI \\nissued show cause notice, inter alia, to RIL, asking RIL to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held in terms of SEBI \\n(Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 and penalty not be imposed \\nunder the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. The Adjudicating Officer of SEBI passed an \\norder on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL. RIL has paid the penalty under protest and has filed an \\nappeal before the SAT against this order.\\n (IV)  Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand notices (“SCNs”) from the Department of \\nTelecommunications (“DOT”), Government of India towards license fees aggregating to C 3,748 crore which includes penalty \\nand interest thereon (Previous Year C 3,620 crore including penalty and interest). The Group has made representations \\nto DOT contesting the basis of such demands. Based on opinion of legal expert, the Group is confident that it has good \\ngrounds on merit to defend itself in the above matter. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that no provision is necessary in \\nrespect of the aforesaid matter.37. Capital Management\\n  The Group adheres to a disciplined Capital Management framework in order to maintain a strong balance sheet. The main \\nobjectives are as follows:\\n a)  Maintain investment grade ratings for all issuing entities, domestically and internationally by ensuring that the financial \\nstrength of their Balance Sheets are preserved.\\n b)  Manage foreign exchange, interest rates and commodity price risk, and minimise the impact of market volatility on earnings. \\n c)  Diversify sources of financing and spread the maturity across tenure buckets in order to manage liquidity risk.\\n d) Leverage optimally in order to maximise shareholder returns.\\n The Net Gearing Ratio at the end of the reporting period was as follows:\\n(C in crore)\\nParticularsAs at  \\n31st March, 2023As at  \\n31st March, 2022\\nGross Debt 3,13,966 2,66,305\\nCash and Marketable Securities * 1,88,200 2,31,490\\nNet Debt (A) 1,25,766 34,815\\nTotal Equity (As per Balance Sheet) (B) 7,15,872 7,79,485\\nNet Gearing Ratio (A/B) 0.18 0.04\\n  *  Cash and Marketable Securities include Cash and Cash Equivalents of C 68,664 crore (Previous Year C 36,178 crore), Current Investments of  \\nC 118,473 crore (Previous Year C 1,08,118 crore), Other Marketable Securities of C 1,022 crore (Previous Year C 87,113 crore including investments \\nin Jio Digital Fibre Private Limited and Summit Digitel Infrastructure Limited) and Share Call money receivable on rights issue of  \\nC\\xa041 crore (Previous Year C 81 crore).\\n38.

B. Financial Risk Management\\n   The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within \\nthe boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the \\nvolatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance. \\n  i) Market Risk\\n    Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes \\nin market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as \\nequity price risk and commodity risk.\\n   a) Foreign Currency Risk\\n     Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are \\ndenominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.\\n     The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial \\ninstruments at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticularsForeign Currency Exposure\\nAs at 31st March, 2023 As at 31st March, 2022\\nUSD EUR JPY USD EUR JPY\\nBorrowings 1,35,702 12,029 11,693 1,17,302 11,998 12,054\\nTrade and Other Payables 85,369 745 76 1,33,506 1,261 60\\nTrade and Other Receivables (12,251) (280) (22) (14,914) (319) (22)\\nDerivatives\\n-  Forwards and Futures (23,921) (11,806) (11,776) (55,442) (12,523) (12,250)\\n-  Options (4,860) 301 96 (2,877) 126 (319)\\nExposure 1,80,039 989 67 1,77,575 543 (477)\\n   b) Interest Rate Risk\\n     The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk, changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair \\nvalues of its financial instruments, principally debt.

The \\nGroup has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity \\nprices and freight costs.\\n    The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control \\nprocesses. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives \\nand uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and \\nfreight exposure.\\n  iii) Credit Risk\\n    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due \\ncausing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and \\nreceivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to \\ncustomers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance \\nfunction, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\\n    The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group \\nGuarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group \\nrestricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n  iv) Liquidity Risk\\n    Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains \\nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local \\nfinancial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure \\nefficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the \\nGroup’s cash flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including \\ncontingencies.\\n    The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. \\nTreasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net \\ndeficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank \\ndeposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to \\navoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars*Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current #@13,449 8,594 27,254 78,290 42,750 62,688 2,33,025\\nCurrent ^77,761 3,500 1,316 - - - 82,577\\nTotal 91,210 12,094 28,570 78,290 42,750 62,688 3,15,602\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 1,491 1,495 2,877 8,820 6,327 15,153 36,163\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 2,658 3,102 405 71 4 - 6,240\\nOptions 106 20 63 35 - - 224\\nInterest Rate Swaps 3 13 44 97 139 3 299\\nTotal 2,767 3,135 512 203 143 3 6,763\\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,47,172 crore.\\n# Includes C 1,190 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 127 crore as revaluation gain.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n^ Includes C 319 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.(C in crore)\\nParticulars*Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022*\\nBelow 3 \\nMonths3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above 5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current # @2,266 6,715 18,207 81,494 44,682 62,456 2,15,820\\nCurrent ^39,736 11,228 1,214 - - - 52,178\\nTotal 42,002 17,943 19,421 81,494 44,682 62,456 2,67,998\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 965 954 1,880 6,765 5,475 6,315 22,354\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 4,740 1,805 1,001 683 - - 8,229\\nOptions 151 2 20 - - - 173\\nInterest Rate Swaps - - 4 598 70 - 672\\nTotal 4,891 1,807 1,025 1,281 70 - 9,074\\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,59,330 crore.\\n# Includes C 1,053 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 48 crore as revaluation gain.\\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n^ Includes C 592 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\\n C. Hedge Accounting\\n   The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and \\nother feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group \\nhas adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved \\nhedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange \\ntraded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve \\nthis objective. \\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a \\nhedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative \\nmethod and critical term matching method.\\n  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. \\n  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:Corporate Overview    Management Review    Governance    Financial Statements\\nConsolidated\\nNOTES  \\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023\\n486 487\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  Disclosure of effect of Hedge Accounting:\\n  A.
